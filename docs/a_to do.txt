----- Things that would be nice to do: ------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------


demo mode...
play a few levels


log flie viewer to load most recent

load gm to not require .gm




I wonder if i can do a work around to load by bitmaps and convert to
a different color depth...


range of levels in vls leave at 1 - 100...done

do the movie file thing...
should be fun and easy...
its going to be a command line only type thing
it will convert a saved game file to movies
run the saved game and save a snapshot each frame...


make a function called clean from command line...
removes unneeded files for release


make linux have a makefile?


make some way to look at all of my older levels....
there are some that i want to check out

what if I changed run lift prox so the mouse would act as the player
triggering the lift??



why do items fall off lifts when lifts go down?
only if you start them that way...if they fall onto lift they are fine...
not sure why???



---------------------------------------------------------------
make option in key to do instant.. not a big priority
---------------------------------------------------------------

should I remove russel's music?
the only reason i have DUMB is to play it..
or convert it to mp3?
can i play mp3 in plain allegro?
doesnt look easy..lets just leave this for now


re-factor enemy move

re-use code between bouncer and cannon
also block walker and archwagon

make enemies that inflict damage on player, add that to their health bonus flower!!
if they have done a bunch of damage to player, they should give up more health on death


Windows 10 bugs.....
----------------------------
color 5 is black
frame and low level rects and lines are slow
load sprit is slow... probably due to get_pixel

----------------------------------------------------------

max size of buttons, in viewers...
640 x 480
ms = 400
panel size = 240 (lools good)

800 x 600
ms = 200
panel size = 200 (ok but cramped a little)

txc sets the centered text position
but lots of stuff ignores it....
leave this for now, too much effort and its fine the way it is
----------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- replace the custom multiline text input for pmsg
- make pmsg static and not dynamically allocate..maybe
- how about make a custom gui for this, that shows the message as its being created
no its just fine like it is...don;t waste the time....
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------
make cannon prox look like trakbot prox
---------------------------------------------------------------
cannon has not prox...duh
----------------------------------------------------------------
what if cannon has a bullet prox like podzilla that will not fire bullet unless player in range?
----------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------
make a completely new way to keep track of solid, empty, etc..
add another dimension to the l array
l[100][100][2]
then in that int you can store:
solid, empty, breakable, bombable, etc
then you can make anything shape act like anything

you can have secret passages, blocks that look solid but are not...
you can have anything be destroyable by bombs....

----------------------------------------------------------

straighten out where collision checking takes place

p bullets happens in proc_pbullets

e bullets happens in enemy_collision

enemy to player collision happens in enemy collision

been thinking about giving a level some text that goes with the start block


been thinking about multiple start blocks for multiplayer.
the lowest numbered player gets this first start and so on

how about some special coins, stars, moons, items, etc that are optional to be found in each level...


how about some special weapons, bubble, bubble style...

in the center of the level, after much unlocking is a special potion
that will destroy all enemies that are inreasingly clonig as you get there.


----------------------------------------------------------------
make a block type that takes multiple hits to destroy
----------------------------------------------------------------
to implement maybe have a sequence of shapes
can't store extra info in a block, or can I...
l[100][100] uses ints and I only go up to 1024 so I have some space up there....


---------------------------------------------------------
make lifts extensions that change lift size, color, etc
---------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------
make an enemy that throws bullets that have gravity
---------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------
make bullets that have gravity
---------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------
make bullets that seek
can change actively change direction towards player
by a set ammount
---------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------
make a sideways (horizontal) sproingy
--------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------
make ladders
completely invisble to enemies, bullets, players, unless up is pressed and player grabs ladder
then player moves with up, down, left, right,
can fall off if goes to far.  can jump off
----------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------
make ropes (horizontal ropes)

completely invisble to enemies, bullets, players, unless up is pressed and player grabs rope
then player moves with left, right, fall off with down
fall off if go past the end far
can jump off (will just fall)

----------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
make an end of level screen that show's the number of bullets fired, number of enemy's killed
start and end times

for each player....

shots fired
enemies hit
enemies killed with bullets
enemies killed with bombs
damage taken
lives lost
free men picked up
other players killed
other players damaged
damage taken from other players
times killed by other players
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
make portal styles switches that only activate when you are standing on them
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
and also have a delay before they switch back after you leave

----------------------------------------------------------------------
make a switch that activates when player is within a range
----------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
make portal stlye companion cube that you can put on switches
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
