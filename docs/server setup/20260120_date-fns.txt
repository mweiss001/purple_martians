sudo apt install npm

npm install date-fns --save


import { differenceInDays } from 'date-fns';

const startDate = new Date(2023, 6, 15);
const endDate = new Date(2023, 6, 22);

// Calculate the number of full days between the two dates
const daysDifference = differenceInDays(endDate, startDate);
console.log(daysDifference); // Output: 7

import { format, formatDistance, formatRelative, subDays } from 'date-fns'

I spend hours trying to figure out how to use date-fns in my js file


the answer:

in the html file that include js

you have to load the js as type module

<script src="./script.js", type="module" ></script>

this also means that the entire js file is interpreted as strict

then in the js file you need the full path to the import like this:

//import format from './date-fns/format';
//import { format } from './date-fns' with { type: “text/html” };

import format from './node_modules/date-fns/format.js';
