sudo apt install npm

npm install date-fns --save


import { differenceInDays } from 'date-fns';

const startDate = new Date(2023, 6, 15);
const endDate = new Date(2023, 6, 22);

// Calculate the number of full days between the two dates
const daysDifference = differenceInDays(endDate, startDate);
console.log(daysDifference); // Output: 7

import { format, formatDistance, formatRelative, subDays } from 'date-fns'

I spent hours trying to figure out how to use date-fns in my js file

the answer:

in bash go to the folder when the js file is

npm install date-fns


in the html file that uses the .js file, you have to load the js as type module
<script src="./script.js", type="module" ></script>

this also means that the entire js file is interpreted as strict

then in the js file you need the full path to the import like this:
import format from './node_modules/date-fns/format.js';
//import format from './date-fns/format';
//import { format } from './date-fns' with { type: “text/html” };

in the process of trying to reduce the size, I converted to cdn

this is 96k:

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/date-fns@3.6.0/cdn.min.js"></script>

these are the only things I used

import format             from './node_modules/date-fns/format.js';
import intervalToDuration from './node_modules/date-fns/intervalToDuration.js';
import differenceInDays   from './node_modules/date-fns/differenceInDays.js';

just prepend any functions with dateFns.
