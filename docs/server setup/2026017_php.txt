I am using php version 8.3.6 on ubuntu 24



Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP.

It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.



I spent a lot of time trying to figure out chartjs-php

gave up, going to try something else

p chart
make a test folder...


installing:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-gd php-freetype


i think all i am missing is 
sudo apt php-gd php-freetype

pchart has not been maintained since 2011

canvasjs??


try google charts
