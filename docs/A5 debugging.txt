To enable logging of allegro's runtime messages, you need to use either the debugging version or the release version with debugging symbols. When building with CMake, these are specified by -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE = {Debug | Release | RelWithDebInfo}

I used Debug

remade the library...

make
sudo make install


In the game:
compiler options: -Wall -g
link with -lallegro_monolith_debug

installed gdb with sudo apt-get install gdb


then in a terminal gdb ./pm

then run

when it crashes, type CTRL-C

then bt or where


Other useful commands in gdb :

info threads

thread apply all bt

thread #

frame #
