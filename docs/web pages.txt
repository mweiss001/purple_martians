How to work with web pages:









I have some perl scripts tp help me rebuild the indexes
I don't remember how to use them...



20220319
I just added a new page
bullets
and I want to add it to the indexes


On github:

created a new repo called mweiss001.github.io

cloned that to c:/web

copied all the files there and commited back
on github the branch was main and on my computer it was master so I had to merge
finally the webpages work!!!!


I made some changes in the local copy at c:/web
Committed them back to github

Then I had to go to my github page and create a pull request...then merge

I think has to do with branches called master and main...??



Install perl

strawberry-perl-5.32.1.1-64bit.msi

looks like it worked

copy web folder to safe place to try playing with it....

cd to tempweb folder

perl mh7.pl


mh7.pl
shows all mh7 tags and in what files

make_toc.pl
iterates all .html files
makes a TOC at the top of each based on mh7 tags in that file...

update_lhs_nav.pl

copies the contents of the file lhs_nav.html and inserts in in every .html file
edit the file first...



OK, now I have 2 copies of web on my dev machine

one is in the c:\pm\web folder

the other is c:\web

I want to reconcile them so I only have one

can I do a git folder inside another one??
