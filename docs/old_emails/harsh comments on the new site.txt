Well, I think you're kind of missing the whole concept of the 'changes'.
Why quotes around changes? Because it's a new site, not really changes
to the old. The AGD has been discontinued.

>1) What was wrong the name 'Allegro Games Depot'?  I don't find the new
>name an improvement.

The new site is actually nameless. It is called Allegro.cc because that 
is the name of the domain. COM,NET,ORG were already taken, so I decided
to go with CC. If you want to continue to call it "Allegro Games Depot",
then feel free to. The old URL "depot.allegro.cc" will eventually
point to the Depot section of the site.

>2) You broke my links to my project on your site

Not at all... it's the same exact data. If you're site is hosted
on something like GeoCities, then they may be blocking external links.

>3) You broke the download counter (stats)

It's not broken, it was reset. I altered the database so I could 
better track usage, bandwidth and external linking. Once there is 
enough data collected, a better user stat tracking system will be 
in place. In the mean time, you can see how many times your project
was viewed, and if it is a top download, see how many times it was
downloaded.

>4) I would like to have the line 'source code:email me' but I am stuck
>with yes or no

This is how it has always been, so I don't understand why this is 
on your list of changes. Boolean values always come in On/Off, Yes/No,
etc. Perhaps I may change it to a drop down with the choices,
"Yes","No","Available upon Request".

>5) Its not very easy to find the bleeding link to send you email
>

Again, this is the same as it's always been. A link on the bottom of 
every single page, as well as on the about section. I think that's a 
pretty standard way of doing it.

I don't mind your comments at all. If all everyone says is "I love the
site!", it won't get any better. But let me explain a few things about
Allegro.cc.

It is not just a compilation of games any more. It is a site that covers
any Allegro related (and semi-related) subjects. This means, it will 
hopefully become a resource for news, games, projects, libraries, 
utilities, etc. I asked many times for people to volunteer to help run
things. I got absolutely no responses. Therefore I felt the best way
was to consolodate everything into a single place so I could easily 
moderate it. If you would like to start up a site pertaining solely to
Allegro games, feel fine. You can model it after any of the old AGD 
looks if you wish. In the meantime, I will continue trying to take steps
forward by adding content to Allegro.cc and improving what is alreay 
there. And I hope to continue to hear suggestions from you and the other
Allegro.cc visitors.

Ah, I understand what you meant. I thought you were referring to allegro.cc
linking to your site, not your site linking to allegro.cc. You should
actually take the UserReference part of it off and you might as well leave
off the
noCache as well.

http://www.allegro.cc/home.taf?_body=viewproject&_id=10631

That is the link you should use. If you keep the UserReference on there,
that
could potentially be dangerous, because it will fool the server into
thinking
that person A & B are the same. Therefore if person A & B both click on that
link and to Allegro.cc, and A logs on as "Mr. Doe", then B is now also
logged
on as "Mr. Doe".

Correct, but there will be more advanced stats later on.

Thank you so much for taking the time to
personally respond and (oh my god!) even
help by sending HTML code examples.

I never expected so high a level of service from
a free site.

I'm sorry again that I was so harsh in criticizing
the site in my first email.

Keep up the good work!

Michael David Weiss

Sorry I was so negative.  I actually like the site.  Overall the good parts
outweigh any minor complaints I might have.

About the Boolean value: source code:[yes|no]
OK so that wasn't a change, but I still would like to register my complaint,
and humbly ask for a change.

As far as the broken link thing goes. I don't use geocities.

The link I used to use was:depot.allegro.cc/game.taf?id=319

The link I now have to use is:www.allegro.cc/home.taf?_body=viewproject&_id=10631&_noCache=616345&_UserReference=858766D6B7993AF4390BA105

Please let me know if I'm doing something wrong or if there is an easier way
to do this.

As far as the counter goes, I used to be able to tell how many people had
downloaded my game
(albeit it was very small number 50 or so), the day that the downloads had
occured on, and the IP address
of the download, now all I get is page hits?

And as far as the email link on the bottom of every page, I see it now, and
it makes perfect sense,
but I was too stupid to realize it earlier, my mistake!  I searched high and
low before I found one on the about page.

I just re-read my original post, and I'm sorry for sounding so harsh, I was
just trying to let you know some things
that had frustrated me.  Please don't think that I don't apprecite the
wonderful site you are building.

Michael Weiss

I don't like a lot of the changes very much.

1) What was wrong the name 'Allegro Games Depot'?  I don't find the new
name an improvement.
2) You broke my links to my project on your site
3) You broke the download counter (stats)
4) I would like to have the line 'source code:email me' but I am stuck
with yes or no
5) Its not very easy to find the bleeding link to send you email

All the things that I used to like about the AGD I still like about the
new site, except where you broke them
Forgive me for sounding harsh but you seem to be changing things just
for the sake of changing them.
If it ain't broke, don't fix it!
