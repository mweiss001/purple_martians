This game has been a long time in the making.

My first introduction to computers was in 1978 when I was 10.

My dad taught electronics at the local college and he brought home
a brand new Commodore PET so he could figure out how they were going
to teach programming to their students.  A few years later it was
replaced with an Apple II+.

I taught myself BASIC and 6502 assembly and tried to write a video game.

Many, many hours and years and thousands of lines of code,
but I was not successfull.

Intrepreted BASIC was too slow, assembly was too complicated,
and my skills were not enough.

















In 1997 I started with DJGPP, RHIDE, and Allegro 

The earliest version I can still find 19980922, has this in the help file.

1997-1998
compiled with DJGPP
(the awesome free C compiler!)

and using Allegro
(the awesome game library for DJGPP!)
 
this is NOT the shareware version
please do not distribute

in 19990905 i found a version of help that said I was using allegro 2.2

on the allegro site 2.2 was released in feb 1997
that's probably the version i started with





I started with Allegro in 1997 in a basement in Victoria, BC, Canada.

I hade been trying to write a game for a long time.

In 1978, when I was 10, I learned BASIC on a Commodore PET
and wrote a few simple programs to manipulate and draw text .

From 1980-1987, I had access to an Apple II+ and spent a lot of time
learning how to program on that.  (280 x 192 hires graphics mode!)
I made some games in BASIC, and assembly.

The BASIC games could not not get fast enough, no matter what.
Probably due to an interpreted language and my lack of skills.

Assembly was better, but my skills were not enough to write such a
complex program in just assembly. 

Then for many years I had no access to a computer, or the time or 
inclination to do anything about it.

I still wanted to create the game I had in my head, with a little man
running around a level, jumping from platform to platform.

Then in 1997, I was in a seasonal layoff from my job over the winter,
waiting on unemployment benefits, and I had a laptop and internet access.

I decided I was going to work on the game I had in my head.

I searched for some proper tools to create games.  I was thinking even
if I had to pirate something, I was going to figure out how to make
my game a reality.  All of the microsoft crap did not appeal to me,
but I resigned myself to go there if I had to.

What I found instead was Allegro.  It looked awesome.  The more I read about
it the more I knew it was what I was looking for.  And the best part was
that it was free!  Nothing to pirate!

The only catch... I would have to learn how to program in C.

I got DJGPP, with RHIDE as my IDE, added Allegro 2.2 and the adventure began!

As I learned C, I was amazed at how logical, simple, precise, elegant it was.
No gotos or line numbers.  And it was really fast!

In my game I built everything from scratch. (Well, except for Allegro!)

I started by learning how to draw on the screen.
Then I made some shapes to blit here and there.
Early on I decided to make my game sprites 20x20 pixels.
I made an bitmap editor to draw and edit these sprites.
I built my own routine for saving and loading bitmaps to disk,
(one get_pixel and put_pixel at a time!)

I decided on a level size or 100x100 blocks made of these shapes.
I used an array of 10,000 ints, int l[100][100].

When I was figuring out how to run my game loop flicker free with a 
screen buffer,  I created a bitmap the size of the whole level:
2000 x 2000 pixels.  4 million pixels!

From 1997 to 2003 I call the first phase of the development.

I always knew I wanted to do some kind of multiplayer.
The game would just be so much better with more players.
It had to be simultaneous multiplayer, just two players
taking turns was never even considered.

Initially, I came up with a split screen method.
I created a second player and re-wrote a lot of code that assumed
there was only one player.

That worked, but the split screens were kind of small.
Still it was really cool to play simultaneously with another player.

I came to realize how awesome it would be if I could do networked multiplayer.

I found libnet and made a simple packet exchange of moves.
That was not too hard, but it didn't do anything to synchronize game states.

I spent a lot of time trying different concepts and abandoning them when
I realized they wouldn't work or I thought of a better way to do it.

In 2003 I released version 5. The netplay stuff didn't work yet, so I 
disabled all traces of it with #ifdef's in the source.

I let it go for a few years until I came back with a vengenance
in 2009-2010 to solve the netplay stuff.

I made a lot of changes and improvements, but still had sync issues.
It would almost run perfectly until they slightly went out of sync.

I had made a lot of changes, but because netplay was broken I didn't
want to release without it.

I let it go again for many years.

I had been thinking about the various methods of syncing, but
was still convicned my method should work.

The method I use is called deterministic lockstep, and I wrote in
depth about it in netplay.txt.

I was almost going to try something like Unity that had built in
network multiplayer.  I even spent a few hours bulding a test project
in Unity and seeing what it would be like to re-do the game in that.
I decided not to for a few reasons.  I wanted do it my way.  I wanted to
figure it out myself.  I didn't want to spend a huge amount of time figuring
out a new platform and porting my game to it.

In 2017-2018 I came back again and tested a new idea I had.
Basically I removed all floats and replaced them with fixed point numbers.
Floats, while very precise, were not as perfectly deterministic across
different systems as I needed. 
Fixed points, while not as accurate, gave the exact same results every time.
After a lot of rewriting, I finally was getting good sync.
I could play some really long games with 3 and 4 players with no problems.

Then I cleaned up a lot of things in the code that I had broken,
refactored just about every line in the game, added new features, removed
some old ones, went through all the levels, updated the help screens,
made a fancy new rotating logo with splines for the splash screen...

Finally here we are with Version 6.
Netplayer with up to 8 players.
Works on Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 10, Ubuntu 16.04.

This will be the final release on Allegro 4.

For the next version, I'll convert to Allegro 5.
