Happy gaming.

P.S. How this game came to be.
I was sitting there one night, playing Bubble Bobble, (I had just discovered MAME) and I decided to search the internet for some game tools.  What I found was djgpp, Allegro, and thus began my introduction to the open source movement.  I love it.  I can't stress that enough.  Open systems are so awesome, adjectives fail me.  I had been trying to write a video game since elementary school in the 70's when I taught myself BASIC on the Commodore PET.  Then I moved to the Apple II and learned some assembly, but I still couldn't write the game I wanted.  As soon as it got barely complex enough to be interesting, it ground to a halt.  So with djgpp and Allegro I finally had all the tools I needed.  The only catch was, I had to learn C.  Which I did.  It is the most elegant language I've used yet, just learning it helped me program more methodically, logically, elegantly, than I ever did in BASIC or assembly.  I wrote this game as I was learning C in the late 90's.

I have been making minor improvements to the game, and in 
the next release I will have network multiplayer capability.

The project is completely C++ now and although I don't use any objects, I would like to redo a lot of the project with objects someday...

Thanks to using 99% Allegro functions to create the program,
I was able to port it to linux with only minor changes.

Russel Hoy wrote some music for the game that I use as background music for the game.  I use the music library DUMB
to play the music in both windows and linux. I have not been 
able to get a hold of Russell for years now, if anyone knows
how to contact him please let me know.
