Setting up Allegro 4 development environment



20180310
--------
windows 7

run dev-cpp-4.9.9.2.exe

Add these packages with Package Manager
- allegro-4.4.2-1len.DevPak
- dumb-CVS_20050418-1mol.DevPak
- zlib-1.2.8-1ext.DevPak

use my own local version of the libnet sources like this:
copy libnet.a to C:\Dev-Cpp\lib
copy libnet.h to C:\Dev-Cpp\include

linker:
"C:\Dev-Cpp\lib\libaldmb.a"
"C:\Dev-Cpp\lib\libdumb.a" 
"C:\Dev-Cpp/lib/libnet.a"
"C:\Dev-Cpp/lib/libwsock32.a"
"C:\Dev-Cpp/lib/liballegro-4.4.2-mt.a"
"C:\Dev-Cpp/lib/libz.a"

open the project file pm.dev with Dev-cpp

Ubuntu 16.0.4.3 desktop is the only Linux system I've tested on,
but there is no reason it should not work on others.


I did a full install of Ubuntu and erased everything on disk.


'sudo apt-get update'

'apt-get install liballegro4-dev'

'apt-get install libaldmb1-dev'

extract the game files to the desktop

- install libnet  (from my local copy of the sources)
from a terminal go to the folder 'libnet' in the game folder
'make lib'
'sudo make install'
(puts libnet.h in /usr/include/)
(puts libnet.a in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/)


You now have all the prerequisites to compile the game.
In a terminal navigate to the 'src' directory of the game.
Run the compile script 'cb' like this './cb'

This is the compile line:
(It has no line breaks, but I have put some here for readablity.)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
g++ -w
e_bitmap.cpp e_editor.cpp e_fnx.cpp e_glt.cpp e_guifnx.cpp
e_item.cpp e_lev.cpp e_menu.cpp e_nev.cpp e_nlv.cpp e_pde.cpp
e_sel.cpp e_sliders.cpp e_special.cpp yfilecom.cpp zbullets.cpp
zcontrol.cpp zemove.cpp zfile.cpp zfnx.cpp zitem.cpp zlifts.cpp
zloop.cpp zmain.cpp zmenu.cpp zplayer.cpp zscrn.cpp zsound.cpp
n_network.cpp n_packet.cpp n_client.cpp n_server.cpp 
-ldumb -laldmb -lalleg -lnet -lpthread -lz -o ../pmlin
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-w (no warnings)

-ldumb -laldmb (these are for DUMB, they need to go before allegro)

-lalleg (the allegro library)

-lnet -lpthread (these are for libnet)

-lz (zlib compression library, for packet compression)

-o ../pmlin (put the executable in the parent directory)

After compiling, go to the main directory and run the game with:

'./pmlin'





















older setups......




windows 7
---------
20140305

still the latest version of dev-cpp is 4.9.9.2

run dev-cpp-4.9.9.2.exe
added allegro-4.2.1-1mol.DevPak with package manager
added dumb-CVS_20050418-1mol.DevPak with package manager

libnet 0.10.11 seem to still be the latest version
extract to C:\libnet 
copy mingw.mak from makfiles to top dir
rename to port.mak
SET PATH=C:\Dev-Cpp\bin
SET MINGDIR=C:\Dev-Cpp
make does not work until I remove -Werror from port.mak
make install does not seem to work
so I manually copy the 2 files like this:
copy libnet.a from \lib      to C:\Dev-Cpp\lib
copy libnet.h from \include  to C:\Dev-Cpp\include



XP SP2
-------

20091209 latest version

run dev-cpp-4.9.9.2.exe

added allegro-4.2.2-1len.DevPak with package manager

dumb-0.9.3
from the command line:
cd to the top directory (the one that contains the src directory)
type:
SET PATH=C:\Dev-Cpp\bin
SET MINGDIR=C:\Dev-Cpp
make
choose M for Ming not D for DJGPP
choose yes for allegro support
make install


libnet-0.10.11
copy mingw.mak from makfiles to top dir
rename to port.mak
SET PATH=C:\Dev-Cpp\bin
SET MINGDIR=C:\Dev-Cpp
make does not work until I remove -Werror from port.mak
make install does not seem to work
so I manually copy the 2 files like this:
copy libnet.a from \lib      to C:\Dev-Cpp\lib
copy libnet.h from \include  to C:\Dev-Cpp\include

compiles clean with no deprecated functions 20091210


Windows XP
----------
Installed DevCpp 4.980
ran alleg4DC.exe and extracted to c:\Dev-Cpp

extract dumb-0.9.2
from the command line:
cd to the top directory (the one that contains the src directory)
type:
SET PATH=C:\Dev-Cpp\bin
SET MINGDIR=C:\Dev-Cpp
make
make install

To get libnet to work...

extract libnet 0.10.9
copy mingw.mak from makfiles to top dir
rename to port.mak
SET PATH=C:\Dev-Cpp\bin
SET MINGDIR=C:\Dev-Cpp
make does not work until I remove -Werror from port.mak
make install does not seem to work
so I manually copy the 2 files like this:
copy libnet.a from \lib      to C:\Dev-Cpp\lib
copy libnet.h from \include  to C:\Dev-Cpp\include

Using
-----
use libnet.h in the source 
link with libnet.a and libwsock32.a


Windows 98 First Edition
------------------------
DirectX 8.1 installed (from file DX81end.exe)
Dev-C++ 4 Installed with typical settings (from devcpp4.zip)
Allegro from superdave (alleg4.zip) unzipped in devc directory (C:\DEV-C++)
Dev-C run once to associate files
Found alleg40.dll on the net and copied to C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM
There are two project:
The game (pmwin.dev)
The editor (pm_editor.dev) 

extract dumb-0.9.2
cd to the top directory (the one that contains the src directory) 
type 'fix mingw'

add C:\Dev-C++\bin to PATH (for make)
SET MINGDIR to C:\Dev-Cpp

'makeall' does not seem to work
so I use 'make' and make 'DEBUGMODE=1'

'make install' does not seem to work even after:
SET MINGDIR to C:\Dev-C++

so I manually copy files like this:
copy *.a from \lib\mingw to C:\Dev-Cpp\lib
copy *.h from \include  to C:\Dev-Cpp\include

You should now be able to compile and execute from the Dev-C IDE
The game executable is pmwin.exe
The level editor executable is pmfle.exe
