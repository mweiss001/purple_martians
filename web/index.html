<br><mh6>History:</mh6>
<mh3>
I started Purple Martians in 1997 in a basement in Victoria, BC, Canada.

I had been trying to write a game for a long time.

In 1978, when I was 10, I learned BASIC on a Commodore PET and wrote a few simple programs to manipulate and draw text.

From 1980-1987, I had access to an Apple II+ and spent a lot of time learning how to program on that.  (280 x 192 hires graphics mode!)
I made some games in BASIC, and later 6502 assembly.

The BASIC games could not not get fast enough, no matter what.
Probably due to an interpreted language and my lack of skills.

Assembly was better, but my skills were not enough to write that complex of a program in assembly.

For many years I had no access to a computer, or the time or inclination to do anything about it.

I still wanted to create the game I had in my head, with a little man running around a level, jumping from platform to platform.

Then in 1997, I was in a seasonal layoff from my job over the winter, waiting on unemployment benefits, and I had a laptop and internet access.

I decided I was going to work on the game I had in my head.

I searched for some proper tools to create games.  I was thinking even if I had to pirate something, I was going to figure out how to make my game a reality.  All of the microsoft crap did not appeal to me, but I resigned myself to go there if I had to.

What I found instead was Allegro.  It looked awesome.  The more I read, the more I knew it was what I was looking for.  And the best part was that it was free!  Nothing to pirate!

The only catch... I would have to learn how to program in C.

I downloaded DJGPP, used RHIDE as my IDE, added Allegro 2.2, and my journey began.

As I learned C, I was amazed at how logical, simple, precise and elegant it is.  No gotos or line numbers.  And it's really fast!

In my game I built everything from scratch. (Well, except for Allegro!)
I started by learning how to draw on the screen.
Then I made some shapes to blit here and there.
Early on I decided to make my game sprites 20x20 pixels.
I made an bitmap editor to draw and edit these sprites.
I built my own routine for saving and loading bitmaps to disk, (one get_pixel and put_pixel at a time!)

I decided on a level size of 100x100 blocks made of these shapes.
I used an array of 10,000 ints, int l[100][100].

When I was figuring out how to run my game loop flicker free with a screen buffer,
I created a bitmap the size of the whole level: 2000 x 2000 pixels.
4 million pixels on a 486 with 8M RAM!

1997-2003 is what I call the first phase of the development.

I always knew I wanted to do some kind of multiplayer.
The game would just be so much better with more players.
It had to be simultaneous multiplayer, like Bubble Bobble.
Just two players taking turns was too boring to be considered.

Initially, I came up with a split screen method.
I created a second player and re-wrote a lot of code that assumed there was only ever going to be one player.

That worked, but the split screens were kind of small.
Still it was really cool to play simultaneously with another player.

I started to think about how amazing networked multiplayer would be.

I found libnet and made a simple packet exchange of moves.
Exchanging game move packets was easy, but synchronizing the game was not.

I spent a lot of time trying different concepts and abandoning them when I realized they wouldn't work or I thought of a better way to do it.

In 2003 I released version 5. The netplay stuff didn't work yet, so I disabled it with #ifdef's in the source.

I let it go for a few years until I came back with a vengenance in 2009-2010 to solve the netplay stuff.

I made a lot of changes and improvements, but still had sync issues.
It would almost run perfectly until they slightly went out of sync.

I had made a lot of changes, but because netplay was broken I held off releasing.
Eventually I gave up and let it go for many years.

I had been thinking about the various methods of syncing, but was still convinced my method should work.

The method I use is called deterministic lockstep, and I wrote in depth about it in netplay.txt.

The concept is that for the exact same set of inputs, the output will be exactly the same.
So if I could just sync the inputs (what controls are pressed on what frame), the output should be identical.

I almost went to the dark side.
I contemplayed trying something like Unity that had built in network multiplayer.
I even spent a few hours bulding a test project in Unity to get a feel of what it would be like to re-do the game in that.

I decided not to for a few reasons.

The most important reasons were personal.

I wanted do it my way.  I wanted to figure it out myself.
    
I didn't want to spend a huge amount of time figuring out how to shoehorn my my project into a game engine where I would have to do things their way.

That is what I love about Allegro.
Its a game programming library, not an engine.
You are free to design your game any way you like.
    
I love that amount of control, and for me, being able to say I figured out how to
do it myself was very important.
    
In 2017-2018 I came back again and tested a new idea I had.
Basically I removed all floats and replaced them with fixed point numbers.
Floats, while very precise, were not as perfectly deterministic across different systems as I needed.
Fixed points, while not as accurate, gave the exact same results every time.

After a lot of rewriting, I finally was getting much better sync.
I could play 3 and 4 players games with minimal problems.

I still had rare occasions that the sync would break.  Often enough that  I couldn't call it fixed.  I wrote a huge amount of logging code, trying to get to the bottom of the problem.

Eventually I started passing some state information from server to clients to tell when the game was going out of sync.

That grew to be more and more information until I thought, why don't I try to send the entire state?

I never designed the game with that in mind, and the structures and arrays holding all of that data were huge.

100 enemies, each with 16 ints and 32 fixed_point
500 items, each with 16 ints and 4 fixed_point
40 lifts structures, each with up to 40 steps
the level block array (100x100) ints
8 player data structures

All of that came in at over 100k.  Way too much to sync with 1K packets.

I did some research and decided to try to use zlib to compress it.
That got my 100K down to around 6-12K.
I wrote code to split it into 1K packets and reassamble them on the clients.
It worked, but it was still too much data and was too slow.
    
At this point I was only using it to check and see if the game had gone out of sync.

Then I came up with a dif method.
Instead of sending the whole 100K, I would only send what had changed.

I basically just subtracted one entire state from another, called that my dif, and compressed that.

That gave me around 600 to 1800 bytes. I would only need 1 or 2 packets!

When I got that working, I decided instead of just checking if I am out of sync, why don't I just use that to correct the state on the clients?

That is the way that it works now.  It checks for differences, but then just overwrites with the new state anyway.
I still check for differences because I want to know what is drifting and see if I can find out why.
Its not really necesary because getting a new state fixes everything.

So now there are two methods for the game sync:
The old original one just sync's the clients inputs.
Every frame, if the clients controls change, a packet with that control change is sent to the server.
The server then consolidates all client inputs, and syncs that back to each client independantly.

The second method periodically sends a new complete state to each client in the form of a dif from the last acknowledged one.

Between these two methods, I can now play very long games, with up to 8 players, across all windows and linux versions, and it works perfectly!

Then I cleaned up a lot of things in the code that I had broken, refactored just about every line in the game, added new features, removed some old ones, went through all the levels, updated the help screens, made a fancy new rotating logo with splines for the splash screen...

Finally on March 11, 2018 I released Version 6.

Netplayer with up to 8 players.
Works on Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 10, Ubuntu 16.04.

Then I almost immediately started on my long overdue plan to convert to Allegro 5.

On April 22, 2018 I released Version 7.

Now with Allegro 5.2.4!
Just about every line (25K) of code has been re-factored.
The display routines have been completely redone.
Now with dynamic resizing while the game is playing!
The linux version now is a precompiled executable.
Numerous small bug fixes and improvements.
