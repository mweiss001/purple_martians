<mh3>
There are two methods used simultaneously in netgame:
- game move sync
- state correction            

Game move sync relies on the game being perfectly deterministic. (The same set of inputs will produce the exact same results).
All that is needed is to replicate the same set of inputs across all the clients.
    
For a long time, game move sync was the only approach I used, and it almost worked perfectly.
But when it didn't, all was lost.  The game would go out of sync between server and client and become unplayable.   
I spent years refining and troubleshooting, added a very complex logging system, replaced floats with fixed points...
I failed.  I could not get it to work reliably enough.

I came upon the second method, state correction, while I was adding code to check if the game had gone out of sync.
I was having the server send player state info to the clients and having them check if that agreed with their local state.
Eventually I expanded this method to send the entire game state periodically, and just overwrite the clients state.
That fixed any drift or loss of sync that occured with the first method. 

Both methods are used at the same time.
Game move sync happens fast, it can send data from client to server and back in a few frames.
State correction takes care of any small drift that might occur, it occurs much less frequently but sends a large amount of data when it does.
</mh3>    
    
<br><a name="Game Move Sync"></a>
<mh7>Game Move Sync</mh7>

<mh3>
To ensure that all players (server and clients) have the same game state, they need the same set of inputs.

The game_moves array contains all player input, indexed by the frame number when a control change occurred.
The state of the controls is not stored every frame, only when a control change occurs.
Every player (server and clients) should have an identical copy of the game moves array.

The server has the master array and syncs that to each client independantly.
When a client's controls change, those changes are sent to the server, put in the master array, then synced back to every client.
    
- client presses a control
- client sends a packet with that data to the server
- server puts it in the master game_moves array
- master game_moves array is synced back to the client
- the client moves by reading the game move from its locally synced game_move array

<img src="images/netgame3.png" width=531 height=411 alt="diagram">
    
This requires that the clients run slightly behind the server. (default is 1 frame or 25ms)

This means there is a delay between when the client presses a control and when the client responds but it is small enough to be barely noticeable.
</mh3>    
    
<br><a name="Client sends control change"></a>
<mh7>Client sends control change</mh7>
    
<mh3>    
The part where a client sends a control change to the server is very simple:

The client checks to see if its controls have changed from the last frame.

If the client's controls have changed, the client sends a 'cdat' packet to the server like this:
</mh3>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">void client_local_control(int p)
{
   set_comp_move_from_player_key_check(p); 
   if (players1[p].old_comp_move != players1[p].comp_move)  // players controls have changed
   {
      players1[p].old_comp_move = players1[p].comp_move;
      Packet("cdat");
      PacketPut1ByteInt(p);
      PacketPut4ByteInt(frame_num + control_lead_frames);
      PacketPut1ByteInt(players1[p].comp_move);
      ClientSend(packetbuffer, packetsize);
   }
}</code></pre>

<br><a name="Server receives control change"></a>
<mh7>Server receives control change</mh7>

<mh3>    
When the server receives a 'cdat' packet from a client:
- the server checks to see if the data is old (contains a frame_num that has already passed on the server)
- if the data is good, it is added to the server's master game moves array
- if the data is old, it is discarded and an error is incremented

If the data is discarded, this is will not cause any sync issues, it will be as if the client never pressed the control at all.

The most common reason for cdat's arriving late is the client lagging too far behind server.
</mh3>    
            
<pre><code class="language-cpp">if(PacketRead("cdat"))
{
   int p = PacketGet1ByteInt();
   int pc = PacketGet4ByteInt();
   int cm = PacketGet1ByteInt();
   // how far ahead is the client's frame_num for this move, compared to server's frame_num
   int c_sync = players1[p].c_sync = pc - frame_num;

   if (c_sync >= 0) add_game_move(pc, 5, p, cm);  // add to game_move array
   else players1[p].c_sync_err++;                 // unless late, then drop and inc error
}</code></pre>
            
<br><a name="Server sends game move data to clients"></a>
<mh7>Server sends game move data to clients</mh7>

<mh3>    
The server synchronizes its master game moves array to each client independantly.

The server knows how many game moves are in its master array with the global int 'game_move_entry_pos'.
The server also tracks the last acknowledged 'game_move_entry_pos' for each player in the player structure.

Every frame the server checks to see if there are un-acknowledged game moves to send for each client.
If there is data to send, the server sends a 'sdat' packet with the needed data to that client.
</mh3>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">void server_send_sdat(void)
{
   for (int p=1; p < NUM_PLAYERS; p++)
      if (players[p].control_method == 2)
      {
         if (players1[p].game_move_entry_pos < game_move_entry_pos) // client needs more data
         {
            int start_entry = players1[p].game_move_entry_pos;
            int end_entry = game_move_entry_pos;
            int num_entries = end_entry - start_entry;
            if (num_entries > 100) num_entries = 100;

            // to prevent multiple resends of exact same data
            if ((players1[p].server_last_sdat_sent_start != start_entry) || // different start pos
               (players1[p].server_last_sdat_sent_num != num_entries))      // different num entries
            {
               players1[p].server_last_sdat_sent_start = start_entry;
               players1[p].server_last_sdat_sent_num = num_entries;
			
               Packet("sdat");
               PacketPut1ByteInt(p);
               PacketPut4ByteInt(frame_num);
               PacketPut4ByteInt(start_entry);
               PacketPut1ByteInt(num_entries);

               for (int x=start_entry; x < start_entry + num_entries; x++)
               {
                  PacketPut4ByteInt(game_moves[x][0]); // frame_num
                  PacketPut1ByteInt(game_moves[x][1]); // type
                  PacketPut1ByteInt(game_moves[x][2]); // data 1
                  PacketPut1ByteInt(game_moves[x][3]); // data 2
               }
               ServerSendTo(packetbuffer, packetsize, players1[p].who, p);
			}   
         }
      }
}</code></pre>
<mh3>
If the server receives an 'sdak' packet (sdat acknowledge), it sets the new acknowledged 'game_move_entry_pos' for that client.
</mh3>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">if(PacketRead("sdak"))
{
   int p = PacketGet1ByteInt();
   players1[p].game_move_entry_pos = PacketGet4ByteInt();
}</code></pre>

    
<br><a name="Client receives game move data from server"></a>
<mh7>Client receives game move data from server</mh7>
<mh3>    
When a client receives game move data from the server, it adds it to its own local game moves array and sends an acknowledgement of the last entry received.
</mh3>    
<pre><code class="language-cpp">if(PacketRead("sdat"))
{
   int start_entry = PacketGet4ByteInt();
   int num_entries = PacketGet1ByteInt();
   int nep = start_entry + num_entries; // new entry position
   if (nep > game_move_entry_pos) // only enter if they are newer
   {
      for (int x=start_entry; x < nep; x++)
      {
         game_moves[x][0] = PacketGet4ByteInt();
         game_moves[x][1] = PacketGet1ByteInt();
         game_moves[x][2] = PacketGet1ByteInt();
         game_moves[x][3] = PacketGet1ByteInt();
         game_move_entry_pos++;
         if ((game_moves[x][0] - frame_num) < 0) // game move arrived too late to be applied
         {
            // bad error, will cause sync loss    
         } 
      }
   }	  
   Packet("sdak"); // send acknowledgement of game moves received
   PacketPut4ByteInt(nep);
   ClientSend(packetbuffer, packetsize);
}</code></pre>
<mh3>When a game move entry is added, the frame_num of the new move is compared to the client's current frame_num.
If the newly entered game move is marked with a frame_num that has already occured on the client, an error is raised.
This is a particularily bad error. It means that a game move has been applied on the server, but arrived too late to be applied on the client.
This will definitely cause the client to be out of sync.
</mh3>    

<br><a name="Timing"></a>
<mh7>Timing</mh7>

<mh3>    
Timing is critical in netgame. The server is the master timing source, and should run at 40fps.

Clients adjust their speed to maintain a slight delay behind the server.
The delay is measured in frames and is controlled by the global int 'server_lead_frames'.
It can be changed in the config file, but should be left at its default of 1 frame (25ms).

The client's timing control is adjusted like this:

- the server sends 'sdat' packets to clients when it has data to send (or periodically for sync if it has no data to send)
- client receives an 'sdat' packet from the server
- embedded in the packet is the server's frame_num of when the packet was sent
- the client compares this to its own frame number and adjusts its fps timer
</mh3>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">if(PacketRead("sdat"))
{
   int sdat_frame_num = PacketGet4ByteInt();
   players1[p].server_sync = sdat_frame_num - frame_num;
   int fps_chase = frame_speed + players1[p].server_sync - server_lead_frames;
   al_set_timer_speed(fps_timer, ( 1 / (float) fps_chase));
}</code></pre>

<br><a name="Control lead frames"></a>
<mh7>Control lead frames</mh7>
<mh3>    
There is an inherent delay in the client's control scheme.

This is because the clients need to send their control changes through the server.

</mh3>
<img src="images/netgame2.png" width=653 height=591 alt="diagram">

<mh3>
To facilitate this, the control changes are sent with their frame_num modified to be in the future.
Then they can make the the round trip through the server and still get back before it's time to apply them.
</mh3>

<pre><code class="language-cpp">void client_local_control(int p)
{
   set_comp_move_from_player_key_check(p); 
   if (players1[p].old_comp_move != players1[p].comp_move)  // players controls have changed
   {
      players1[p].old_comp_move = players1[p].comp_move;
      Packet("cdat");
      PacketPut1ByteInt(p);
      PacketPut4ByteInt(frame_num + control_lead_frames); // add control_lead_frames to frame_num
      PacketPut1ByteInt(players1[p].comp_move);
      ClientSend(packetbuffer, packetsize);
   }
}</code></pre>

<mh3>
The global variable 'control_lead_frames' is set in the config file, but should be left at its default value of 3. 

Any lower than 3 and sometimes the data will not return in time.

At settings higher than 3, the control lag becomes more noticeable.

I have found 3 to be a good compromise. 3 frames is 75ms which is a barely noticeable control lag, and late cdats are rare.

To make things fair for all players, the server has the same delay applied to its control changes.
</mh3>

<pre><code class="language-cpp">void server_local_control(int p)
{
   set_comp_move_from_player_key_check(p);                  
   if (players1[p].comp_move != players1[p].old_comp_move)  // players controls have changed
   {
      players1[p].old_comp_move = players1[p].comp_move;
      int fpc = frame_num + control_lead_frames;            // add control_lead_frames to frame_num
      add_game_move(fpc, 5, p, players1[p].comp_move);
   }

<mh3>
There are data structures for 8 players, numbered from 0-7.

- single player is always player 0
- server is always player 0
- clients can be from 1-7

The global variable 'active_local_player' points to the the local player.

</mh3>


<br><a name="Player control methods"></a>
<mh7>Player control methods</mh7>

An integer in the player structure:

1 = file play (run demo game from file)
2 = in netgame, any non-local player (client players on server, and server and other clients on client) 
3 = in netgame, local server player on server
4 = in netgame, local client player on client 
99 = in netgame, used client in current level (to prevent re-use in same level)

</mh3>

<br><a name="Level Done"></a>
<mh7>Level Done</mh7>
<mh3>    
When any player touches an exit or warp, the global variable level_done is set.
</mh3>

<pre><code class="language-cpp">void proc_item_collision()
{
...
   case 3: // exit
   {
      level_done = 1;
      next_level = play_level + 1;
   }
   break;
   case 12: // warp
   {
     level_done = 1;
	 next_level = item[x][8];
   }
   break;
}
</code></pre>

<mh3>    
In single player mode, the function proc_controllers() adds the level done game move: 
</mh3>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">if (players[p].control_method == 0) // local single player control
   if (level_done) add_game_move(frame_num, 6, 0, 0); // insert level done into game move
</code></pre>

<mh3>    
In server mode, the function server_local_control() adds the level done game move: 
</mh3>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">void server_local_control(int p)
{
   if (level_done) add_game_move(fpc, 6, 0, 0); // insert level done into game move
}</code></pre>


<mh3>    
In client mode, the client never adds ANY game moves to its array directly, they all come from the server. 



Then in all modes, the level done game move is processed by 'proc_game_move(void)'
This calls the function: 'proc_level_done()'
</mh3>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">void proc_level_done(void)
