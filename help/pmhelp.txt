<c15>Your mission is to escape from the dungeons of a strange planet

<c15>where your ship crashed.  Armed only with your plasma pistol,

<c15>you must fight enemies who want to kill you and find the exit.



      <a01>       <a02>       <a14>       <a15>       <a17>       <a29>       <a31>

<c04>Exits

<c15>Every level has at least one exit.

                              <a22>

<section>Netgame


<c13>Network Multiplayer Game Mode
<c15>_________________________________


<c15>Netgame allows up to 8 players to simultaneously play together.

<c15>Each player is on a different computer and they all communicate.

<c15>This works even if some computers are running Windows and

<c15>some are running Linux.

<c15>_________________________________


<c15>One player will act as the Server and host the Netgame.

<c15>Up to seven other players can join as Clients.

<c15>_________________________________


<c15>Clients require the Server's IP or hostname to be set in:

<c15>"Settings" -> "Netgame"

<c15>_________________________________


<c15>For a LAN is is pretty easy to set up.

<c15>If the computers can ping each other, (and firewall rules are set)

<c15>that is all that is needed.

<c15>_________________________________


<c15>To make it work over the internet is non-trivial.

<c15>With port forwarding, DMZ's and other tricks and hacks, it can be done.

<c15>This is an issue that has nothing to do with this game and everything

<c15>to do with Peer-to-Peer Communication Across Network Address Translators.

<c15>The method I used was to have the server in a DMZ, or directly

<c15>connected to the internet (no router).

<b15>

<c15>Netgame has couple of specific game options:


<c09>Deathmatch Player Bullets:[ON|OFF]
<c09>____________________________________

<c15>Can a player's bullets hurt another player?

<c15>If [OFF] they will have no effect on other players.


<c09>Suicide Player Bullets:[ON|OFF]
<c09>_________________________________

<c15>Can a player hurt themselves with their own bullets?

<c15>I know what you are thinking.  How can a player shoot themselves?

<c15>Well suppose they shoot a bullet, then travel instantly with

<c15>a door to a place where their own bullet can hit them.

<c15>If [ON] a player will be able to shoot themself.


<c09>Deathmatch Bullets Damage:
<c09>____________________________

<c15>How much damage player's bullets do to other players and themselves.

<c15>100 will instantly kill. 0 will do no damage (but still recoil).

<c15>You can even set a negative value to give health!

<section>Installation and System Requirements




<c13>The game does not need to be installed.  Run it from its own folder.

<c13>It is self contained and does not store anything outside this folder.


<c15>_____________________________________________________________________

<c15>Here is list of systems the game has been tested on:

<c15>Windows 7
<c15>Windows 10
<c15>ubuntu 20.04
<c15>ubuntu 22.04
<c15>Linux Mint 20.3
<c15>Manjaro 21.2.4
<c15>MX-21
<c15>Fedora 35

<c15>_____________________________________________________________________


<c15>To run in windows, extract and run 'pm.exe'

<c15>_____________________________________________________________________


<c15>To run in linux, extract and run 'pm'

<c15>If it complains about missing libraries, start the game with the script
<c15>'pml', which sets up a local library path first



<section>Config File


<c15>The game uses the config file "pm.cfg" to store persistent data.


<c15>You can manually edit the file, but the best way to change
<c15>settings is to use the "Settings" pages in the game.


<c15>If the file "pm.cfg" is deleted, it will be re-created with defaults.

Some objects can do both.

<b15>

Example:

A Orb configured to emit event 5 if a player touches it.
A Cloner is configured to initiate a clone when it detects event 5.

<b15>

<c09>Objects that can listen for events:

Cloner       - Listens for event then initiates clone action.

Block Damage - Listens for event then alters damage rectangle.

Block Manip  - Listens for event then manipulates blocks in rectangle.

Lift         - Waits at lift step for event before continuing.

Timer        - Waits for event before continuing timing sequence.

<b15>

<c09>Objects that can emit events:

Trigger - Monitors a rectangular area for the presence or absence of
          object, then emits events based on that.

Orb     - Emits events when touched or shot by player, or when player 
          presses up or down while touching it.

Lift    - Emits events when current lift step is a send event type.

Timer   - Emits events based on timers.

<section>History



I started with Allegro in 1997 in a basement in Victoria, BC, Canada.

I had been trying to write a game for a long time.

In 1978, when I was 10, I learned BASIC on a Commodore PET
and wrote a few simple programs to manipulate and draw text.

From 1980-1987, I had access to an Apple II+ and spent a lot of time
learning how to program on that.  (280 x 192 hires graphics mode!)
I made some games in BASIC, and assembly.

The BASIC games could not not get fast enough, no matter what.
Probably due to an interpreted language and my lack of skills.

Assembly was better, but my skills were not enough to write that
complex of a program in assembly.

For many years I had no access to a computer, or the time or
inclination to do anything about it.

I still wanted to create the game I had in my head, with a little man
running around a level, jumping from platform to platform.

Then in 1997, I was in a seasonal layoff from my job over the winter,
waiting on unemployment benefits, and I had a laptop and internet access.

I decided I was going to work on the game I had in my head.

I searched for some proper tools to create games.  I was thinking even
if I had to pirate something, I was going to figure out how to make
my game a reality.  All of the microsoft crap did not appeal to me,
but I resigned myself to go there if I had to.

What I found instead was Allegro.  It looked awesome.  The more I read,
the more I knew it was what I was looking for.  And the best part was
that it was free!  Nothing to pirate!

The only catch... I would have to learn how to program in C.

I downloaded DJGPP, used RHIDE as my IDE, and added Allegro 2.2.

As I learned C, I was amazed at how logical, simple, precise and elegant
it is.  No gotos or line numbers.  And it's really fast!

In my game I built everything from scratch. (Well, except for Allegro!)
I started by learning how to draw on the screen.
Then I made some shapes to blit here and there.
Early on I decided to make my game sprites 20x20 pixels.
I made an bitmap editor to draw and edit these sprites.
I built my own routine for saving and loading bitmaps to disk,
(one get_pixel and put_pixel at a time!)

I decided on a level size of 100x100 blocks made of these shapes.
I used an array of 10,000 ints, int l[100][100].

When I was figuring out how to run my game loop flicker free with a
screen buffer,  I created a bitmap the size of the whole level:
2000 x 2000 pixels.  4 million pixels!

From 1997 to 2003 I call the first phase of the development.

I always knew I wanted to do some kind of multiplayer.
The game would just be so much better with more players.
It had to be simultaneous multiplayer, like Bubble Bobble.
Just two players taking turns was never even considered.

Initially, I came up with a split screen method.
I created a second player and re-wrote a lot of code that assumed
there was only ever going to be one player.

That worked, but the split screens were kind of small.
Still it was really cool to play simultaneously with another player.

I started to think about how amazing networked multiplayer would be.

I found libnet and made a simple packet exchange of moves.
Exchanging game move packets was easy, but synchronizing the game was not.

I spent a lot of time trying different concepts and abandoning them when
I realized they wouldn't work or I thought of a better way to do it.

In 2003 I released version 5. The netplay stuff didn't work yet, so I
disabled all traces of it with #ifdef's in the source.

I let it go for a few years until I came back with a vengeance
in 2009-2010 to solve the netplay stuff.

I made a lot of changes and improvements, but still had sync issues.
It would almost run perfectly until they slightly went out of sync.

I had made a lot of changes, but because netplay was broken I didn't want
to release without it.  Eventually I gave up and let it go for many years.

I had been thinking about the various methods of syncing, but
was still convinced my method should work.

The method I use is called deterministic lockstep, and I wrote in
depth about it in netplay.txt.

The concept is that for the exact same set of inputs, the output will
be exactly the same.  So if I could just sync the inputs (what controls 
are pressed on what frame), the output should be identical.

I was almost going to try something like Unity that had built in
network multiplayer.  I even spent a few hours building a test project
in Unity and seeing what it would be like to re-do the game in that.
I decided not to for a few reasons.  I wanted do it my way.  I wanted to
figure it out myself.  I didn't want to spend a huge amount of time
figuring out a new platform and porting my game to it.

In 2017-2018 I came back again and tested a new idea I had.
Basically I removed all floats and replaced them with fixed point numbers.
Floats, while very precise, were not as perfectly deterministic across
different systems as I needed.
Fixed points, while not as accurate, gave the exact same results every time.
After a lot of rewriting, I finally was getting good sync.
I could play 3 and 4 players games with no problems.

I still had rare occasions that the sync would break.  Often enough that 
I couldn't call it fixed.  I wrote a huge amount of logging code, trying
to get to the bottom of the problem.

Eventually I started passing some state information from server to clients
to tell when the game was going out of sync.

That grew to be more and more information until I thought, why don't I try 
to send the entire state?

I never designed the game with that in mind, and the structures and arrays
holding all of that data were huge.

100 enemies, each with 16 ints and 32 fixed_point
500 items,   each with 16 ints and 4 fixed_point
40 lifts structures, each with up to 40 steps
the level block array (100x100) ints
8 player data structures

All of that came in at over 100k.  Way too much to sync with 1K packets.

I did some research and decided to try to use zlib to compress it.
That got my 100K down to around 6-12K.
I wrote code to split it into 1K packets and reassemble them on the
clients.  It worked, but it was still too much data and was too slow.
At this point I was only using it to check and see if the game had
gone out of sync.

Then I came up with a dif method.  Instead of sending the whole 100K,
I would only send what had changed.

I basically just subtracted one entire state from another, called that
my dif, and compressed that.

That gave me around 600 to 1800 bytes. I would only need 1 or 2 packets!

When I got that working, I decided instead of just checking if I am out 
of sync, why don't I just use that to correct the state on the clients?

That is the way that it works now.  It checks for differences, but then
just overwrites with the new state anyway.  I still check for
differences because I want to know what is drifting and see if I can
find out why. Its not really necessary because getting a new state fixes
everything.

So there are two methods for the game sync:
The old original one just sync's the clients inputs.  Every frame, if
the clients controls change, a packet with that control change is sent
to the server.  The server then consolidates all client inputs, and
syncs that back to each client independently.

The second method periodically sends a new complete state to each
client in the form of a dif from the last acknowledged one.

Between these two methods, I can now play very long games, with up
to 8 players, across all windows and linux versions, and it works
perfectly!

Then I cleaned up a lot of things in the code that I had broken,
refactored just about every line in the game, added new features, removed
some old ones, went through all the levels, updated the help screens,
made a fancy new rotating logo with splines for the splash screen...

Finally here we are on March 11, 2018 with Version 6.

Netplayer with up to 8 players.
Works on Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 10, Ubuntu 16.04.

This will be the final release on Allegro 4.
For the next version, I'll convert to Allegro 5.

Well here we are again on April 22, 2018 with Version 7.
Now with Allegro 5.2.4!
Just about every line (25K) of code has been re-factored.
The display routines have been completely redone.
Now with dynamic resizing while the game is playing!
The linux version now is a precompiled executable.
Numerous small bug fixes and improvements.

Updated to Version 7.24 on October 18, 2022
Added some new items, enemies, redid levels...
