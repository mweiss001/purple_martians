<section>Netgame


<c13>LAN Network Multiplayer Game Mode
<c15>_________________________________


<c15>To run a Netgame, the computers must be in the

<c15>same subnet and be able to ping each other.

<c15>_________________________________


<c15>One player will act as the Server and host the Netgame.

<c15>Up to seven other players can join as Clients.

<c15>_________________________________


<c15>Each Client needs to have the Server's IP or hostname set in:

<c15>"Options Menu" -> "Netgame Options"

<c15>_________________________________


<c15>Clients will use what the Server tells them for:

<c15>Player Color,  Level,  FPS (frames per second)

<c15>Deathmatch Player Bullets, Suicide Player Bullets


<b15>

<c15>Netgame has couple of specific game options:


<c09>Deathmatch Player Bullets:[ON|OFF]
<c09>____________________________________

<c15>Can a player's bullets hurt another player?

<c15>If [OFF] they will have no effect on other players.


<c09>Suicide Player Bullets:[ON|OFF]
<c09>_________________________________

<c15>Can a player hurt themselves with their own bullets?

<c15>I know what you are thinking.  How can a player shoot themselves?

<c15>Well suppose they shoot a bullet, then travel instantly with

<c15>a door to a place where their own bullet can hit them.

<c15>If [ON] a player will be able to shoot themself.


<c09>Deathmatch Bullets Damage:
<c09>____________________________

<c15>How much damage player's bullets do to other players and themselves.

<section>Installation and System Requirements

<c13>It is self contained and does not store anything outside this folder.


<c15>_____________________________________________________________________



Recently, the game has been developed and tested on Windows 7.

Here is list of other systems I have tested the game on:

Windows XP 
Windows 7
Windows 10
ubuntu-16.04.4-desktop-amd64
ubuntu-17.10.1-desktop-amd64
linuxmint-18.3-cinnamon-64bit
elementaryos-0.4.1-stable.20180214
antergos-18.4-x86_64
CentOS-7-x86_64-LiveGNOME-1708
CentOS-7-x86_64-LiveKDE-1708
Fedora-Workstation-Live-x86_64-27-1.6

To run in windows, extract and run 'pm.exe'

To run in linux, extract and run the script 'pml'
- the executable is 'pm', the script 'pml' sets up some libaries first
- optionally you could copy the contents of /linux_libs to /usr/lib

<section>History



I started with Allegro in 1997 in a basement in Victoria, BC, Canada.

I hade been trying to write a game for a long time.

In 1978, when I was 10, I learned BASIC on a Commodore PET
and wrote a few simple programs to manipulate and draw text.

From 1980-1987, I had access to an Apple II+ and spent a lot of time
learning how to program on that.  (280 x 192 hires graphics mode!)
I made some games in BASIC, and assembly.

The BASIC games could not not get fast enough, no matter what.
Probably due to an interpreted language and my lack of skills.

Assembly was better, but my skills were not enough to write that
complex of a program in assembly.

For many years I had no access to a computer, or the time or
inclination to do anything about it.

I still wanted to create the game I had in my head, with a little man
running around a level, jumping from platform to platform.

Then in 1997, I was in a seasonal layoff from my job over the winter,
waiting on unemployment benefits, and I had a laptop and internet access.

I decided I was going to work on the game I had in my head.

I searched for some proper tools to create games.  I was thinking even
if I had to pirate something, I was going to figure out how to make
my game a reality.  All of the microsoft crap did not appeal to me,
but I resigned myself to go there if I had to.

What I found instead was Allegro.  It looked awesome.  The more I read,
the more I knew it was what I was looking for.  And the best part was
that it was free!  Nothing to pirate!

The only catch... I would have to learn how to program in C.

I downloaded DJGPP, used RHIDE as my IDE, and added Allegro 2.2.

As I learned C, I was amazed at how logical, simple, precise and elegant
it is.  No gotos or line numbers.  And it's really fast!

In my game I built everything from scratch. (Well, except for Allegro!)
I started by learning how to draw on the screen.
Then I made some shapes to blit here and there.
Early on I decided to make my game sprites 20x20 pixels.
I made an bitmap editor to draw and edit these sprites.
I built my own routine for saving and loading bitmaps to disk,
(one get_pixel and put_pixel at a time!)

I decided on a level size or 100x100 blocks made of these shapes.
I used an array of 10,000 ints, int l[100][100].

When I was figuring out how to run my game loop flicker free with a
screen buffer,  I created a bitmap the size of the whole level:
2000 x 2000 pixels.  4 million pixels!

From 1997 to 2003 I call the first phase of the development.

I always knew I wanted to do some kind of multiplayer.
The game would just be so much better with more players.
It had to be simultaneous multiplayer, just two players
taking turns was never even considered.

Initially, I came up with a split screen method.
I created a second player and re-wrote a lot of code that assumed
there was only one player.

That worked, but the split screens were kind of small.
Still it was really cool to play simultaneously with another player.

I started to think about how amazing networked multiplayer would be.

I found libnet and made a simple packet exchange of moves.
Exchanging game move packets was easy, but synchronizing the game was not.

I spent a lot of time trying different concepts and abandoning them when
I realized they wouldn't work or I thought of a better way to do it.

In 2003 I released version 5. The netplay stuff didn't work yet, so I
disabled all traces of it with #ifdef's in the source.

I let it go for a few years until I came back with a vengenance
in 2009-2010 to solve the netplay stuff.

I made a lot of changes and improvements, but still had sync issues.
It would almost run perfectly until they slightly went out of sync.

I had made a lot of changes, but because netplay was broken I didn't
want to release without it.

I let it go again for many years.

I had been thinking about the various methods of syncing, but
was still convinced my method should work.

The method I use is called deterministic lockstep, and I wrote in
depth about it in netplay.txt.

I was almost going to try something like Unity that had built in
network multiplayer.  I even spent a few hours bulding a test project
in Unity and seeing what it would be like to re-do the game in that.
I decided not to for a few reasons.  I wanted do it my way.  I wanted to
figure it out myself.  I didn't want to spend a huge amount of time
figuring out a new platform and porting my game to it.

In 2017-2018 I came back again and tested a new idea I had.
Basically I removed all floats and replaced them with fixed point numbers.
Floats, while very precise, were not as perfectly deterministic across
different systems as I needed.
Fixed points, while not as accurate, gave the exact same results every time.
After a lot of rewriting, I finally was getting good sync.
I could play some really long games with 3 and 4 players with no problems.

Then I cleaned up a lot of things in the code that I had broken,
refactored just about every line in the game, added new features, removed
some old ones, went through all the levels, updated the help screens,
made a fancy new rotating logo with splines for the splash screen...

Finally here we are on March 11, 2018 with Version 6.

Netplayer with up to 8 players.
Works on Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 10, Ubuntu 16.04.

This will be the final release on Allegro 4.
For the next version, I'll convert to Allegro 5.

Well here we are again on April 22, 2018 with Version 7.
Now with Allegro 5.2.4!
Just about every line (25K) of code has been re-factored.
The display routines have been completely redone.
Now with dynamic resizing while the game is playing!
The linux version now is a precompiled executable.
Numerous small bug fixes and improvements.
