---   Trigger Event System   ---
--------------------------------


Is a method for objects to communicate with each other.

Uses class mwTriggerEvent
and member array int event[1000];


Trigger Event transmitters or emitters set a specific event in the array by setting it to 1.

Trigger Event receivers check for a specific event in the array.


Transmitters are responsible for clearing the event, not receivers.
The method works like this.
When an object is checking is it will set an event, first it clears it.
This allows multiple receivers to do something with the event.

This also means that muliple senders of the same event will not work as the other senders might clear.

Item Trigger
item[][11] = CURR ON  pm_event
item[][12] = CURR OFF pm_event
item[][13] = TGON pm_event #
item[][14] = TGOF pm_event #

Item Orb
item[][10] = STATE ON  pm_event
item[][11] = STATE OFF pm_event
item[][12] = TGON pm_event
item[][13] = TGOF pm_event

Item Timer
item[][13] = t1 o/p event
item[][15] = t2 o/p event

Lift Step type 6

Block Damage
item[][1] 

Block Manip
item[][1] 

Item Timer
item[][12] = t1 i/p event
item[][14] = t2 i/p event

Lift Step type 5


to specify an object I will need three variables:
obj_type
obj_num
obj_ext

       obj_type obj_num obj_ext
item      2       num    n/a
orb       2       num    n/a
trigger   2       num    n/a
timer     2       num    timer number
enemy     3       num    n/a
lift      4       step   lift




I plan to add:
receiver:
cloner
message
