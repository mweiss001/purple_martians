Server Client File Transfer


A method to transfer a file between server and client with an established connection.

Why?

I was thinking of using this also to send logs, but that has not yet been implemented.


--------------------------------------------------------
Case 1: Transfer the Server's .gm file to all clients
--------------------------------------------------------

The game moves array on client is incomplete and could never be used to play back the level.
It only has game moves from the local client.

The game moves array on the server can be saved to a gm file and sent to the client.


Where and how does this happen:
-------------------------------
void mwGameMoves::save_gm_make_fn(const char* description)
calls the function:
void mwGameMoves::save_gm(const char *fname)
that has this code:

         if (mNetgame.ima_server) // if server, send to all active clients
         {
            for (int p=1; p<NUM_PLAYERS; p++)
               if ((mPlayer.syn[p].active) && (mPlayer.syn[p].control_method == PM_PLAYER_CONTROL_METHOD_NETGAME_REMOTE))
                  mNetgame.server_add_file_to_send(fname, mPlayer.loc[p].who);
         }

So it can only happen on the server, and only when this function is called.


When is this function called?
----------------------------------

- in mLoop at 'level_done' or 'level_quit'
- in function key check force save
- when server receives crfl packet 

When does client send crfl?
---------------------------
-  if ((mNetgame.ima_client) && (serial_key_test("sendfile"))) mNetgame.client_send_crfl();

-  if (state[1] == PM_PROGRAM_STATE_CLIENT_PREEXIT1)
   {
      if (mGameMoves.autosave_game_on_level_quit)
      {
         // when client quits with escape, send a file request to the server to get the gm file
         mNetgame.client_send_crfl();
