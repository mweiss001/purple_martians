github pages:

https://happycoding.io/tutorials/html/github-pages


GitHub is a website that lets you post your code so you can keep it organized and share it with other people. It’s a little bit like social media for coders, and it’s a great way to show off your code and to see what other folks are working on.

GitHub Pages lets you take a GitHub repository and turn it into a webpage. In other words, you can use a GitHub repository to host your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. This tutorial walks you through the process of creating a GitHub Pages site!

I’m assuming you’ve already worked through the GitHub profile README tutorial and that you’ve created your first GitHub repository and practiced some HTML with your GitHub profile README. If not, go do that now and then come back!
Create a Repository

There are two different types of GitHub Pages repositories:

User sites are hosted at https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io and are used for things like personal homepages, portfolio pages, and other sites associated with you as a user. To create a user site GitHub Pages repository, create a repo named YOUR_USERNAME.github.io.

Project sites are hosted at https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO_NAME and are used for documentation related to a specific repo, or standalone pages. To create a project site GitHub Pages repository, create a repo with any name, and then either:

    Create a branch in that repo named gh-pages.
    Go to the Settings tab of your repo and enable GitHub Pages for the main branch (or any branch you want).




I cant seem to get the one for my project to work...

I have branches called gh-pages...


I got the one for my personal page to work....

created a new repo called mweiss001.github.io


cloned that to c:/web

copied all the files there and commited back
on github the branch was main and on my computer it was master so I had to merge
finally the webpages work!!!!

made a release on github as well...




I am trying to get the project one to work:

https://mweiss001.github.io/purple_martians/


just serves a default page


looks like it want to use either the root folder or docs...

fine...I'll move everything to pm_docs and try my web stuff in docs...

do this locally then commit....

I think it is working now....

remove the old one.....or just make a link to the new one....


clone to desktop
https://github.com/mweiss001/mweiss001.github.io
delete all and make index redirect to other page
commit...



-------------------------------------
I think it is working now.
-----------------------------------



The old one was https://mweiss001.github.io
and should redirect to the new one

The new one is: https://mweiss001.github.io/purple_martians/
and it works fine


I should just be able to make changes and commit my project, and the web pages will change too.
