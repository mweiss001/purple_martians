
pm needs:
liballegro_monolith.so.5.2 


some distro's are also missing:
libOpenGL.so.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libOpenGL.so.0

I used to also need libdumb, until I switched from pm.xm to pm.wav for the theme music



I set -rpath in the executable to point at ./linux_libs
This only works for liballegro_monolith.so.5.2 
If other libraries are missing it won't find them there

In my script 'lin_make_release' I copy these libraries to ./linux_libs like this

cp /usr/lib/liballegro_monolith.so.5.2 ./linux_libs/
cp /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libOpenGL.so.0 ./linux_libs/


When the program is extracted and used on a different system one of these things happens:

1:
libOpenGL.so.0 is already installed on the system
./pm works


2:
libOpenGL.so.0 is not already installed on the system
./pml works


I made an install script 'install_linux_libs' that copies the libaries to /usr/lib where they should be found


new script 'install_linux_libs'

cp ./linux_libs/liballegro_monolith.so.5.2  /usr/lib/ -v
cp ./linux_libs/libOpenGL.so.0 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ -v
