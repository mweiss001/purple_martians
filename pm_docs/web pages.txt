How to work with web pages:

I have some perl scripts to help me rebuild the indexes

mh7.pl
shows where all mh7 tags are in all .html files

make_toc.pl
iterates all .html files
makes a TOC at the top of each based on mh7 tags in that file...

update_lhs_nav.pl
copies the contents of the file lhs_nav.html and inserts in in every .html file
edit the file first...

In my project I renamed my docs folder to pm_docs, so that I could use docs for the web pages
Then I put all the web content there.

Now to edit I just make changes to the web pages in the docs folder.
When I commit the web pages are automatically updated.
