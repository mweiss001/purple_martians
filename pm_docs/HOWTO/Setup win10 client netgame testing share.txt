
How to setup local shares for windows machines in your local network.

This is used when testing, debugging and developing netgame.

Changes are made on the development machine, then copied to clients via a windows share.


look in mwMainArgs.cpp for the function 

void mwMain::copy_files_to_clients(int type)

and find a name to use:

examples:

   sprintf(client[num_clients++], "\\\\e6430-w10\\pm_client50");
   sprintf(client[num_clients++], "\\\\o7040\\pm_client51");

I am going to use pm_client52 

Now on the client machine:

Network and Sharing Center
Make sure the network profile is set to private
Click Advanced Sharing Options
Under 'Private' profile turn on file and print sharing
Under "All networks' turn off password protected sharing

On the desktop create a folder called pm_client_52

right-clieck -> properties -> sharing tab

click share

select everyone from drop down list and add

change from read to read/write

then click share

at this point the share works, but the path is: \\zulu\Users\m\Desktop\pm_client52

then go to advanced sharing
- check share this folder
- click permissions and chose full control for everyone

now the share is: \\zulu\pm_client52


right-click on desktop and create shortcut
C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe
name:pm

then right click and change Start in: to C:\Users\m\Desktop\pm_client52
