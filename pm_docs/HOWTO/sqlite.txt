

Install sqlite on windows.

    Step 1 − Go to SQLite download page, and download precompiled binaries from Windows section.

    Step 2 − Download sqlite-shell-win32-*.zip and sqlite-dll-win32-*.zip zipped files.

    Step 3 − Create a folder C:\>sqlite and unzip above two zipped files in this folder, which will give you sqlite3.def, sqlite3.dll and sqlite3.exe files.

    Step 4 − Add C:\>sqlite in your PATH environment variable and finally go to the command prompt and issue sqlite3 command, which should display the following result.

C:\>sqlite3

create a database:

do this from regular command prompt.

OK now what?

try to connect with c++


#include <stdio.h>
#include <sqlite3.h> 

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
   sqlite3 *db;
   char *zErrMsg = 0;
   int rc;

   rc = sqlite3_open("test.db", &db);

   if( rc ) {
      fprintf(stderr, "Can't open database: %s\n", sqlite3_errmsg(db));
      return(0);
   } else {
      fprintf(stderr, "Opened database successfully\n");
   }
   sqlite3_close(db);
}



downloaded the amalgamation
put sqlite.c and sqlite.h in my source dir
added sqlite.c to the project

#include <sqlite3.h> 

void mwMain::temp_test(void)
{

   sqlite3 *db;
   char *zErrMsg = 0;
   int rc;

   rc = sqlite3_open("test.db", &db);

   if( rc ) {
      fprintf(stderr, "Can't open database: %s\n", sqlite3_errmsg(db));
      return;
   } else {
      fprintf(stderr, "Opened database successfully\n");
   }
   sqlite3_close(db);


compiles and works....

what did it do to my executable?


pm.exe is now 16.3M
removed and now it is 15.2M


I have worked through tutorials to connect to database, create and drop tables insert and select...

now lets see what I have to do to get it to work on linux....

copy all the sources to pmh




had to manually compile with this line:
gcc -Wall -c src/sqlite3.c -o o/src/sqlite.o

many errors if trying to compile with g++

it fucking works!!

it makes test.db in the pm dir

so now what?

can something else on the server read the database?

what should I do next...

...........

how do I get qt to read that database?



here is the answer....
sql is not a network database....


OK..does this invalidate everything I have been doing up to here?

Do I absolutely need the remote access to the database?

If I view it in a web context I can use php and read the db locally...

When I want to look at the data with my qt app, then I probably need to connect to a remote database.
Other ways of doing it:
copy the sqlite database file from the server to the machine running qt..
this is not that far fetched...
I could have smaller database files, rotate them, 

The other way would be to stick with mysql...
Figure out how to do database stuff in c++

This would be nice if the clients could send a packet to the server and the server would enter into the database
Still there is the issue of a lot of log entries filling up the database


I had an idea:

First of all, just make sure that the clients send all their log messages to the server.

Then on the server, you can do whatever you want, you will have all the log messages.

You could:
- use syslog udp packets to insert them into syslog. then parse and move them to other tables
- figure out how to insert them into the right databases from c++ code.
- save them to disk in a format that is easy to import directly into a database of your choice


This sounds good enough that I think I will try to implement it.

The first thing is how do I get all the log lines from the client to the server...

Naive first thought is to just blast them out with 1 packet as they happen.
Its kind of like how I am alreay doing it.

I am thinking about making a structure in my game for log lines.
kind of mirror what I do in pm_log


timestamp
frame_num
player_num
client_num (only valid on server)
message_type
message text

then I could send a few of these in a compressed packet...



the reasons for converting my log system to a structure of lines
- when I send them to the server I can do more than one line per packet
- i know when the server has got them with an acknowledge
- when I go to dump them to disk they are already structured...


this all sounds like a huge rewrite of the logging system

it might be worth it...


at all the places in the code where log messages are created, I should have a single simple way of doing that...

add_log_entry(p1 p2 frame agt message_type, message)

then if they are printed do one thing
logged to file, do another
added to struct for db insert file 


---------------------

what is the simplest thing I could do next?
make client send logs in a new packet type as they occur...

make server receive and process these new log lines
