did the meta package, not the flathub

the usb adapter seems to work in linux...

how do I do bridge mode?



3. Configuring the Network Bridge on Linux with ip tool

In this section, we will explain how to manage a network bridge with the ip tool from the iproute2 package, which is needed by the basic meta-package.

Iproute2 is a collection of Linux applications for managing TCP/IP networking and network traffic. Currently, Stephen Hemminger is responsible for its maintenance. Alexey Kuznetsov, the original creator, is well-known for implementing QoS in the Linux kernel.

Most network setup guides still include ifconfig and route as the key network configuration tools, despite the fact that ifconfig is notoriously ineffective in current network situations. The majority of distributions continue to include them.

iproute2 is often distributed as part of a package named iproute or iproute2 and consists of many tools, the most essential of which being ip and tc. ip manages IPv4 and IPv6 settings, whereas tc regulates traffic. Both programs generate comprehensive use warnings and are supplemented by a collection of man pages.

You may configure the Linux Bridge with ip tool by following the next steps:

    Installing the ip tool
    Creating a Bridge interface with ip tool
    Adding Devices to a Bridge with ip tool
    Viewing interfaces in a Bridge with ip tool

3.1. Installing the ip tool

To install ip tool on Debian/Ubuntu run the following command:

apt install iproute

3.2. Creating a Bridge interface with ip tool

To create a new bridge and change its state to up, you may run the next command:

ip link add name br0 type bridge

ip link set br0 up

This will create a new bridge device with a name br0.

To delete a bridge you may run the following command:

ip link delete br0 type bridge

3.3. Adding Devices to a Bridge with ip tool

To add the interface into the bridge by setting its master to br0, you may run the next command:

ip link set ens18 master br0

ip link set ens19 master br0

This will add the two interfaces ens18 and ens19 to bridge br0.

To remove an interface from a bridge device, you may run the following command:

ip link set ens18 nomaster

3.4. Viewing interfaces in a Bridge with ip tool

To view the summary of the overall bridge status run the next command shown below:

bridge link

sudo ip link add name br0 type bridge
sudo ip link set br0 up
sudo ip link set eno1 master br0
sudo ip link set enxa0cec8e94d1a master br0
sudo bridge link

it is passing data....


run wireshark as root or you cant see eno1

filter ip.addr == 96.45.9.166 and udp

I need to start wireshark as root, easiest way is from terminal
seems to be working...

to get a packet dump from machine:


save it to home...

pscp -pw ***** m@192.168.1.123:*.txt c:\pm
