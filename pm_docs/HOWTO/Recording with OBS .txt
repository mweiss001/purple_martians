20240219 I think I am going to start over..

I am using m36

I have OBS Studio version 27.2.4 installed already but there is a newer version 30.0.2

ran the update...


I think what I want to do is run the game fullscreen on a second monitor, this is what I did before...

so, connect a 1920 x 1080 monitor...

in the game settings show display adapters...

edit pm.cfg and set:
mDisplay.display_adapter_num=1

then when you run the game and make it fullscreen, it will use the second monitor...


Now to get OBS to record...


under sources, chose display and picked the correct display (I just noticed is is 1920x1200)

then I started recording and did some things and it worked


videos are saved to C:\Users\m\Videos

mp4 video


the video says it is 1920x1080 60Hz 1200kbps



file->settings

video tab:
1920x1080 60Hz

output tab:
quality: high q med file size
format: mp4
vid enc: Hardware (NVENC, H.264)
aud enc: AAC
