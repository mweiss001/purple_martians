How to work with web pages:

The web pages are in the folder 'docs'.
This was forced on me by github. It cannot be named anything else if I want to use the free github webpage host.

In my project I renamed my old 'docs' folder to 'pm_docs, that is where all the other documentation is.

To make changes, I manually edit the web pages in the docs folder.
When I commit the web pages are automatically updated.

I have perl scripts to automate some tasks like rebuilding indexes.


How to run a perl script:
Start command prompt and navigate to the docs folder
Run a script with 'perl <scriptname>'


'make_toc.pl'
Iterates all .html files and makes a TOC at the top of each based on mh7 tags in that file.


'update_lhs_nav.pl'
copies the contents of the file 'lhs_nav.html' and inserts in in every .html file
(note: edit lhs_nav.html first)


'update_footer.pl'
copies the contents of the file 'footer.html' and inserts in in every .html file
(note: edit footer.html first)


'mh7.pl'
shows where all mh7 tags are in all .html files


'show_tags.pl [tag]'
shows where all [tag] tags are in all .html files


I have used various perl distributions, the latest one is used I set up like this:
20230128 win 10
strawberry-perl-5.32.1.1.-64bit.msi
setx path "%path%;C:\Strawberry\perl\bin"


I now have my own domain name: purplemartians.org

I host an official netgame server and my webpages.

To edit and change web pages:
They are still in pm/docs

Edit them in place on your dev machine.
When committing they will still get hosted on github automatically.

Here is how to manually copy them from my windows dev machine to my server at purplemartians.org

win_copy_to_pmh.bat html_delete_all
win_copy_to_pmh.bat html_copy_all
win_copy_to_pmh.bat html_copy_html
