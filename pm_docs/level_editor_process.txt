High level description of the process for level editor


I is started by calling:
edit_menu(start_level)

edit_menu sets some stuff up, then does this loop

   while (mW[8].active)
   {
      cm_redraw_level_editor_background();
      if (!mw_cycle_windows(0)) cm_process_mouse();
      cm_process_keypress();
   }


cm_redraw_level_editor_background();
- proc_event_queue
- does the delay (currently by calling proc_event_queue and waiting on program_update)
- gets new background
- draws lifts, enemies, items
- draws overlay specific to mode
- gets new screen buffer


if (!mw_cycle_windows(0)) cm_process_mouse();
- processes and draws all active windows for this mode
- if the mouse is not on any window, process mouse for background


cm_process_keypress();
- runs custom handler for ovm
- checks for ESC in all modes for quit
- runs the exit dialog for last chance to abort or save before quit
