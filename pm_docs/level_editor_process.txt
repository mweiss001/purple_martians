High level description of the process for level editor


It is started by calling:
edit_menu(start_level)


edit_menu sets some stuff up, then does this loop

   while (mW[8].active)
   {
      cm_redraw_level_editor_background();
      if (!mw_cycle_windows(0)) cm_process_mouse();
      cm_process_keypress();
   }


cm_redraw_level_editor_background();
- proc_event_queue
- only draws if program_update set 

- flips display
- gets new background
- draws lifts, enemies, items
- draws overlay specific to mode
- gets new screen buffer


if (!mw_cycle_windows(0)) cm_process_mouse();
- processes and draws all active windows for this mode
- if the mouse is not on any window, process mouse for background



cm_process_keypress();
- runs custom handler for ovm
- checks for ESC in all modes for quit
- runs the exit dialog for last chance to abort or save before quit









mw_cycle_windows(0) in more detail:


   for (int a=0; a<NUM_MW; a++) mW[a].check_offscreen();


draw windows in order, top last, detecting mouse on window as we go

  // at this point, all windows have been drawn in order
  // and 'mouse_on_window' is set to the top window that has the mouse on it


process the window that has focus 

mW[a].process_mouse();
