Hi Michael

I've just downloaded your *VERY* cool Purple Martians, I can't stop playing
it :o)

I'm trying to write my own game too, but not having allot of success. I'm
learning C but I'm running into some difficulties.

Can you please e-mail me your source for Purple Martians, It would help me
allot to see how it's done. In return I will write a sound track for it if
you like.

Thanks

Russ.

Hi Michael

I would like to give you a *BIG* thanks for sending your Purple Martians
source, I look forward to the next version. If I have time I will maybe do a
Christmas level with blocks in the shape of Santa or something :o)

Did you want any music done for PM, if you do, what format would you like it
to be.

Thanks

Russ.

Hi Michael

You can listen to the music using Modplayer at http://www.modplug.com

I use Jgmod to play music in allegro, it's a *VERY* good library, you can
get it at http://www.geocities.com/siliconvalley/vista/8890
