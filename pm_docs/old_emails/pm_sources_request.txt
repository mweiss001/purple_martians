Sure, OK, you talked me into it!

Here is the source, and yes, you can post it.

You can do anything you want with it, use routines, hack it to pieces,

But please leave the credit page intact!!

By the way the map stretching routines are pretty simple..see stimp() and stamp()...hee hee hee

The level editor is PMFLE
And the game is PMFV

Hi, I know you haven't given out your source code because you think people might make fun, or there is just some cryptic kludge in there that even you can't figure it out anymore, but I think it might be helpful to some people.  I myself am a beginner as well.  I have only made Pong and am now making Space Invader/Galaga type game.  I am interested in something like what you did.  The screen scrolling and shrinking of the screen to show the whole map, then the zooming in was awesome by the way.
Anyways, I got a site, you can check it out if you like, I am not going to post the source on my site unless you say its cool (and if you give it to me) But I would like it just to check it out myself, and maybe learn something.

Hey I like the game but you need some revamp on your images, and tilesets. Do you have a friend that is good a drawing?, because that is what me and my friend Leo do, He is a great coder, and I am good at the art, and design concept. So we both contribute to make the games have a little more style. It is fun. Cool Game!
