The warp item is used mostly in level 1 to immediately jump to the training and demo levels and return to the same place.


How does it work?

When warping to a level and the level you are warping from is > 1, save the level you are warping from in 'warp_level_location'

Then in the level you warp to, when set_player_start_pos() is called,

if 'warp_level_location' is not zero, it tries to find a warp item that matches 'warp_level_location' 

if it does, the player's position is set to 1 block below the warp.
