see if I can figure out how to make a wrapper for printf


#include <stdarg.h>

int write_log(int priority, const char *format, ...)
{
    va_list args;
    va_start(args, format);

    if(priority & PRIO_LOG)
            vprintf(format, args);

    va_end(args);
}


this was so easy to do!!!

what can I use it to replace?

all the log stuff....



old:

      if (mLog.LOG_NET_stdf)
      {
         sprintf(msg, "stdf saved server state[1]:%d\n", mLoop.frame_num);
         //printf(msg);
         mLog.add_log_entry2(27, 0, msg);
      }


new:

      if (mLog.LOG_NET_stdf) mLog.add_log_entry2(27, 0, "stdf saved server state[1]:%d\n", mLoop.frame_num);


also add to the log stuff a parameter if I want to print to console


add_log_entry2 occurances 41


this is the first successfull replacement

      if (mLog.LOG_NET_stdf) mLog.add_log_entry3(27, 0, 1, "stdf saved server state[1]:%d\n", mLoop.frame_num);

//      if (mLog.LOG_NET_stdf)
//      {
//         sprintf(msg, "stdf saved server state[1]:%d\n", mLoop.frame_num);
//         //printf(msg);
//         mLog.add_log_entry2(27, 0, msg);
//      }


1 line instead of 6...nice...do more


I am thinking of going one further


I want to have the log id numbers as defines

then do something like:

old:

if (mLog.LOG_NET_stdf) mLog.add_log_entry3(27, 0, 1, "stdf saved server state[1]:%d\n", mLoop.frame_num);

new:

mLog.add_log_entry3(LOG_NET_stdf_num, 0, 1, "stdf saved server state[1]:%d\n", mLoop.frame_num);

then in the function use that number and test
I can also add if I want to print that to the console...I can use this everywhere!!

I am doing this...

how many mLog.add_log_entry2? 29

how many can I switch?


I am down to 15 left...mostly when I want to print to console also... but sometimes when I spend a long complicated time building a string...




in bottom message draw_text...rearrange so msg is last, then make another draw_textf..done..not many use new function...

in log message also extend others that take a char as an arg

82 void mwLog::add_log_entry_position_text(int type, int player, int width, int pos, const char *txt, const char *border, const char *fill)
31 void mwLog::add_log_entry_centered_text(int type, int player, int width, const char *txt, const char *border, const char *fill)
20 void mwLog::add_log_entry_header(int type, int player, const char *txt, int blank_lines)

step 1 rearrange parameters so that txt is last

done...

setp 2 add a f type wrapper to each

done:

step 3 do replacements

26 82 void mwLog::add_log_entry_position_text(int type, int player, int width, int pos, const char *txt, const char *border, const char *fill)
31 31 void mwLog::add_log_entry_centered_text(int type, int player, int width, const char *txt, const char *border, const char *fill)
8 20 void mwLog::add_log_entry_header(int type, int player, const char *txt, int blank_lines)

done and push...































































where can I do one place to store version?

so it will show in the compiled program
and also be used for lin and win build scripts

I could just change it in three places...code (pm.h), win and lin make_release..
bump all now to 7.24.0826.1
done...



figure out netgame

I need more documetation...


add more at the end of client timing sync??

there is some better descriptions of both in ping...


this is what I have set right now:

loc[p].client_chase_offset_auto_offset = -0.02;

mPlayer.loc[0].server_state_freq = 1 + mcp/25; // use max_client_ping to set server_state_freq


how am I going to test, and what am I going to vary?

what is up with the client sync adjust?

It does not work like I want it to...

auto mode you can still adjust the offset
manual mode you cannot adjust anything??


I still am lost at how to adjust these things

at the very least add loc[p].client_chase_offset_auto_offset = -0.02; to config

maybe it should be somewhere else rather than the player struct...


I want to move these from loc struct to netgame class


   double client_chase_offset;
   double client_chase_offset_auto_offset;
   int client_chase_offset_mode; // 0 = manual, 1 = auto

done...

what is the default stdf_freq if not auto?


I want to be able to remotely monitor and control the server

I am thinking of some dedicated packets for this:

server will send a big chunk of data to a monitoring computer
like logs and graphs, but in real time

server will accept control packets from the same computer..

but what would I send to control? stdf freq?

I am thinking that I don't want to ever have stdf freq less than 2

but I am not really able to see what affect I am having..

base resets are the most important thing....

I am not sure why lower stdf freq is desirable.
Is it to reduce the size of corrections?

I have played with stdf of 10 and did not see any problems...
it made the initial join take longer

I want to move stdf freq from loc to netgame, just like cco
done...
also add actual value to config and allow to change in settings...done

bump ver and push




I want to see the client sync graph...figure it out...

      if (log_lines_int[i][0] == 30) // stak line
      {
         int p = log_lines_int[i][1];




   sprintf(msg, "%s %s\n", tmsg1, tmsg2);
   if (mLog.LOG_NET_server_rx_stak) mLog.add_log_entry2(33, p, msg);


change 30 to 33

also needs 10? for player active

x_axis_draw_gridlines_and_labels(0);


fixed a bug in graph...

void mwGraph::x_axis_draw_gridlines_and_labels(int set_size_only)


this while would block, so i added a guard to not do it if labels are not drawn

         // find out if major gridline labels will touch each other....
         if (x_axis_grid_label_draw_on)
         {
            int max_space_between_labels = - 9999;
            while (max_space_between_labels < 10)
            {


Now, here is how client_sync_graph works:

- only can run on server
- need to have LOG_NET_server_rx_stak logging enabled
- (optional) need to have LOG_NET enabled if you want to see when clients became active


Fixed all the help entries related to logs...

segfault when opening log...why?

so many fucking bugs!  arrrghhh!!!

fixed bug in get tag that errored when tag was not found


now moving on:

I was wanting to see how the slow chase happens with larger stdf_freq

LAN e6430 server stdf manual 2
start frame 237, lock 303

LAN e6430 server stdf manual 4
start frame 285, lock 384

LAN e6430 server stdf manual 6
start frame 203, lock 339

LAN e6430 server stdf manual 8
start frame 198, lock 372

LAN e6430 server stdf manual 10
start frame 209, lock 422

so I dont see much with this data, but what I do see is that with larger stdf the graph swings up and down more

what the hell is ping graph and what do I need to do to make it work?

   tags[36][0] = 1; tags[36][1] = 13; tags[36][3] = 84; sprintf(ctags[36], "tmaj"); // timer adjust (T) [C]
   tags[37][0] = 1; tags[37][1] = 13; tags[37][3] = 78; sprintf(ctags[37], "cpng"); // client ping  (N) [C]


with higher stdf_freq   dsysnc really has a cyclic pattern

what can I do about that?

can I make packets used for sync different from stdf...

what if I made ping packets once per frame?

hell I was going to send stdf once per frame!!

wait a tick here! I don't use stdf packets for timing....i use pong...

and they only come once every 2s!!! no wonder my chase loop oscillates


compare:


LAN e6430 server stdf manual 10 ping_freq:20
-22 -17 -23 -18 -23 -18
-39.9 - 40.1 on a 2-3 sec sine wave


LAN e6430 server stdf manual 10 ping_freq:2
-29 -12 -27 -13 -26 -14
-39.5 - 40.4 on a 2-3 sec sine wave


LAN e6430 server stdf manual 10 ping_freq:40 (every frame)

I am getting bad results doing it that way...


what if the server just broadcasts ticks

then the client can lock onto those

the client can reply and then the server will know the client time...

I can also make the tick more accurate


why is the dysnc on a 2s cycle, no matter what ping or stdf freq?
I don't know...


DUH!
client timer adjust is based on stdf dsync

that is where it is adjusted

all ping does is set chase offset....


this seems far more complicated than it needs to be...

I want to adjust time more often than when stdf's are received

otherwise stdf's could be my tick

put the ping back

stick it in with the 1Hz stuff

try stdf freq of 4, fixed and see if you can tweak the loop
the chase has very little cycling


what bad things happen when s1 never goes below 4?

I dont know


lets do another release and try over the internet....

seems to work good with manual stdf of 4, 3, 2

the only bad thing is the non local players seem to jump around a lot

but its pretty much the same with 4, 3, 2


I think that this is just the way that it is....



20230827 where am I at?

trying to put the finishing touches on netgame

the most noticeable thing is other players in a netgame
they jump and warp a lot


can you put a number on it?

can you make it less severe?

I think that faster stdf and less offset would make it look better

how can i measure?

I need to do more monitoring on the client, that is where you see all the jumpiness

how about max player correction for any active player...done

it does not show much difference because....

local client has been updated with local moves since last state
remote ones have not

this does not help, it actually is the opposite

try it with a large stdf and see...

tried with 8
remote cor max up to 40
local cor max up to 20

this actually looks like I'm onto something, or just confirming what I already knew

I want to document all the tools I have for monitoring and measuring netgame...

Starting with this...

wait a minute, should I measure corr after ff?

what am I trying to do here


original method:
get pos now
compare to past corrected pos

new method:
get pos now
compare to past corrected pos then played forward to now

alt:
rewind and get pos
apply and compare


of all the methods new seems best.
it compares now to corrected now


what is client_move_lag

measured on client when applying dif

mPlayer.loc[p].client_move_lag = mLoop.frame_num - client_state_dif_src;

what does it mean?

how far back the base frame is.

how many frames the client has been free running before it is corrected

directly related to stdf freq



what is client_rewind

int ff = mPlayer.loc[p].client_rewind = mLoop.frame_num - client_state_dif_dst; // dst compared to current mLoop.frame_num

measured on client when applying dif

the amount of frames that are ff replayed after a dif is applied

directly related to offset??, yes!!

It seems like I am better understanding this now....

the only thing to adjust on the server is stdf_freq

the only thing client can control is their timing relationship to the server

I was adjusting stdf freq based on max client ping, but maybe I should just make that fixed and adjust client offset

I have some values I am trying to minimize:

client_rewind
client_move_lag
late cdats

speaking of late cdats on the client, could I make that part of syn?

it is not documented??

server sets


change

   int late_cdats;
   int late_cdats_last_sec;

from loc to syn

I want to see them on the client and I don't want to pass them both with specialized packets

add 8 more spare ints to syn...done...

old:
psyn is 2304
tot is 112128

new:
psyn is 2304
tot is 112384

now move from loc to syn...done

now remove from packet exchange..done

now show in client debug grid

BUGS i am pretty sure that server rewind is clearing these....

      // save values we don't want rewound
      int lcd[8][2] = { 0 };
      for (int pp=0; pp<NUM_PLAYERS; pp++)
         if (mPlayer.syn[pp].active)
         {
            lcd[pp][0] = mPlayer.syn[pp].late_cdats;
            lcd[pp][1] = mPlayer.syn[pp].late_cdats_last_sec;
         }

      state_to_game_vars(srv_client_state[0][1]);   // apply rewind state
      mLoop.frame_num = srv_client_state_frame_num[0][1]; // set rewind frame num
      mLoop.loop_frame(ff);

      // restore
      for (int pp=0; pp<NUM_PLAYERS; pp++)
         if (mPlayer.syn[pp].active)
         {
            mPlayer.syn[pp].late_cdats = lcd[pp][0];
            mPlayer.syn[pp].late_cdats_last_sec = lcd[pp][1];
         }

fixed...

bump version and release...
kill all data and config too..

remove late cdats line, now in grid
add cor to client grid
done


lag also, but maybe rename

think up better names for rewind and lag


client_rewind

int ff = mPlayer.loc[p].client_rewind = mLoop.frame_num - client_state_dif_dst; // dst compared to current mLoop.frame_num

measured on client when applying dif

the amount of frames that are ff replayed after a dif is applied

directly related to offset??, yes!!


other name that might be more descriptive:
client_replay_frames
client_ff_frames


releated to client_lag which is:

measured on client when applying dif

mPlayer.loc[p].client_move_lag = mLoop.frame_num - client_state_dif_src;

what does it mean?

how far back the base frame is.

directly related to stdf freq

how many frames the client has been free running before it is corrected
not exactly??


    +-------------+---------------+
base_frame   state_frame    current_frame

cf-sf = client_rewind
cf-bf = client_lag

what if I showed a graphic representation of this:

record the values when dif is applied

sfd (src frame_delta)
dfd (dst frame_delta)


I just realized that frame span between sfd and dfd is stdf_freq..

I really want to see this graphically in real time on the client


+--+--+
s d c





what if I send the entire game state every frame
always based on state zero

why?

just to see what it does

what kind of bandwidth are we talking here?

would it help with retransmits

how can I easily swap this in for testing?

what do I get before


do this with m36 as server and e6430 as client....

s1:2 no base resets 5kB
s1:1 no base resets 7kB
size 300



base 0
70K
size 3000


make it optional with stdf_freq = 0??


check what actually is going on...

is s1 == 1 everyframe?

no...wtf??

new state:359   s1:2
new state:362   s1:2
new state:365   s1:2
new state:368   s1:2
new state:371   s1:2

new state:393   s1:1
new state:395   s1:1
new state:397   s1:1
new state:399   s1:1
new state:401   s1:1

new state:484   s1:0
new state:485   s1:0
new state:486   s1:0



this is not what I expected, it could explain many things....

if (mLoop.frame_num >= srv_client_state_frame_num[0][1] + s1)    // is it time to create a new state?

change it so that it does what I expect...

if (mLoop.frame_num >= srv_client_state_frame_num[0][1] + s1 -1)    // is it time to create a new state?


0 = every frame and no base
1 = every frame
2 = every 2 frame
3 = every 3 frame


new state:191   s1:3
new state:194   s1:3
new state:197   s1:3

140K
size 3000


lets bump, deploy and test

can I make my headless server still detect serial key check?


it works over the internet with s1=0

each client uses about 140kB/s

still does not look much better with the warping corrections

my nice graphical thing is broken...it depends on the stdf src, which I am setting to zero for base reset reasons...

why do I even care about dif src?

I just liked having something to show on the client...

why not just the time from now to the dest of the dif...

that is crwd or ff


If I leave s1:0

the only other thing I can adjust is the client offset...
and I want to monitor crwd...

I can get 2 with offset > 25

and 1 with < 25


but I cant do < 25 when ping is 30

try local

m36 server and 2 clients
each has 330kps for a total of 670kbps  wow
I guess it depends on the level
that was level 64
level 1 has 135 each for a total of 270


does not seem to make much difference in the warping...
its better I think, but not dramatically better, hard to tell...

what is stsy, cdsy and gmav on server debug grid?




stsy - server stak sync
mPlayer.loc[p].stak_dsync*1000);
when server rx stak, how long did it take from client
not really used, more like a ping time


cdsy - client dsync
mPlayer.loc[p].dsync
calculated by client and passed to server with stak packets


gmav - client game move sync avg last sec
when server processes cdat it compares the time to the current server time
tallies average last sec for each client



I really want to be able to control and monitor the headless server remotely



how?

a seperate program connected with my own custom packet exchange?


or a connected client can just open a debug connection to the server

I want to see the full debug overlay, and be able to control s1 and zc


it would be easier (maybe) to base it off a connected client

put the client in a special inactive state...


or I could make my own connection...
independant of the netgame


I want to write up what I have discovered today. Formally, so I do not have to discover it again later.

First of all the good news. Netgame is working well. As good as possible with the current algorithm.

Now for the bad news.

Not really bad, but there is some warping of non-local clients on other clients games.

It looks like the player is twitching and jumping around.

Its really not that bad, but I spent a lot of time and effort to see if I could get rid of it or at least minimize it.


There are only a few adjustable things in the game.

On the server, the rate the states are sent.

On the the client, the timing offset in relation to the server.


First of all, lets discuss stdf_freq, the rate the server send states to clients.

0 = every frame and no base
1 = every frame
2 = every 2 frames
3 = every 3 frames

The more often they are sent, the less corrections on the clients.

This time I even made a new setting, 0, which in addition to sending states every frame,
also gets rid of the need for a base to make a diff with.

This was attempted to see what would happen.  Here is what happens:
The amount of bandwidth increases almost 10 times.

There might be a slight improvement in the client corrections, but its barely noticeable.
The functionality is left there to experiment with.
All you need to do is manually set stdf_freq to 0;

The end result is that will probably always use manual 1 for stdf_freq.


Next of all is client_offset.

In order for things to run as smooth as possible, with the fewest corrections, client offset should be as low as possible.

In a LAN with low ping times you can set client_offset as low as 5-10;

If you set it too low you will get late_cdats. Where the server gets input too late to be applied.


























-------------------------------------

If I do not need states for making clients difs, could I keep extra for late_cdats

I am not sure what I am talking about here...


I am adjusting client sync to get very close to the server, but as I get too close I get late cdats...


ideally I would get the dif on the frame it was needed, but then my input would be...


what would happen if I kept more states on the server, like 20, enough for 500ms of game time
then late cdats would not be an issue?

but how late of an input would I allow to affect the current state?

am i onto something here or am I just crazy?


what would it take to test?



an array of game states

lets just do 8 for now


   // server's last 8 states for rewinding
   char srv_rewind_state[8][STATE_SIZE];
   int srv_rewind_state_frame_num[8];


now every frame save state

how will I juggle the circular array?

find oldest and overwrite...


in function server rewind...

I will need to keep track of dirty frames

how about earliest new game move

wait..game move is not sorted..i can use that to my advantage

how about looking back

each time a state is made, also store gmep for that frame

then and this get tricky here

cf = 100

I have states from 92-99 stored

take the oldest state
look for new moves that match that state

I could just play back and make new ones, that seems simpler

- load oldest state
- step one frame at a time and save states

this all seems so complex

why do I not make the one that I base these on one frame earlier...

I am so confused....



when server makes a new state it overwrites the old base state

I want it to keep at least one older version

then when rewinding go back to the earliest version

then save newest and bump that to oldest



this is sounding like something that might work...


when server makes a new state save also save it in my new array and overwrite the oldest position



when server rewinds, find the oldest state in the array and load from there


wow! this is so simple and is just crazy enough to work



I need a good way of finding the oldest (min) frame_number

initialize array with mn = std::numeric_limits<int>::max();

     // also save in array

     // find lowest frame number
     int mn = std::numeric_limits<int>::max();
     int indx = 0;
     for (int i=0; i<8; i++)
     {
        if (srv_rewind_state_frame_num[i] < mn)
        {
           mn = srv_rewind_state_frame_num[i];
           indx = i;
        }
     }


     memcpy(srv_rewind_state[indx], srv_client_state[0][1], STATE_SIZE);

OK I have patched it in...lets take it for a ride


my min max bullshit doesn't work

start with zero


what do I want?

when adding I want to remove the lowest

when fetching I want to find the lowest

have -1 as unset....

when adding, do all -1 first, then lowest

when fetching, ignore -1



OK I have patched it in and it works, right up until I get late cdats, then it all goes to hell

do I even need to toss late cdats? they will not be executed...
I do because I want know that they are occuring and I want to be able to play back the save game


I could easily remove this new code I have added....


I was thinking...does this not require the client to also have the previuos state?
no...client base states are different, but are they?

I could test with s1 = 0...

It looks like its a server problem...







































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































make the cannon facing direction optional

make the shortcut keys in the menu optional
also shortcut key in vls

make functionality to save level if if beats the best time with purple coins
that means I will need to track that also...

make it so that demo current level on overworld does something besides open file select
maybe that is not so bad...

-------------------------------
-- Random thoughts and ideas --
-------------------------------


look at making screen double do values other than integers like 1.5

make "Rollin" play over final cutscene
time:93s

how long for all children to get in rocket?
30s
how long for rocket to fly





should I redo my commandline stuff to have an arbitrary number of options in any order
spec out exactly what you want.
each chuck should contain no whitespace, use that as a delimiter

-e
-e:<int>

-p
-p:<int>

-s
-sh

-c
-c<host>





Make some examples of vinepods to show off in levels
vinepod triggering another vinepod in a chain
vinepod triggering a group of vinepods in a star
vinepod getting out of the way of a shot aimed at it

vinepod flower on good and evil?
also on incinerator??


I could also do an eco draw for vinepods....



when a level is completed and sets a new time record < par and all purple coins collected
auto save that level in a special folder

here are the rules:
- level completed
- all coins
- time less than max so far

this makes me think I might need 2 speed records
one for all coins and one for not..
maybe I could just not count a speed record if all coins are not collected
too much work, just leave it...



what about messages and in level stats only show on local screen?
unless they are the show always type...
level_stats is a message also...
there is no mechanism in message to determine which player to show it for..
it would take a lot to add functionality to display different for each player
skip this




can I add level name to the filename
How would that look?

level002.pml

level002_Switch_Nest.pml






I am thinking of having some more buttons on the top of the edit menu

be able to toggle scroll at screen edge on/off
lock screen pos
scroll level by click and drag
zoom level with mouse wheel





working on making the ft_sel look better
all the info I need is in the ft_
the secondaries already have the right offset but the drawing routine can only get it from the real item data structs
I hate re invent or duplicate the drawing routines, can I just extend the exiting ones to pass explicit secondary, like I pass explicit x and y for cutom drawing?


why did I remove skip frame draw?
because 99% of the time, the thing was taking too much time was draw frame itself
netgame expects that the move frames happen exactly when they are supposed to
if I draw then I will screw up the timimg of netgame
I tried a staggered draw but the flashing was too much...
what I did not try was:
frame 1 get new back ground and draw


wait a tick here!
I have discovered that drawing from bitmap to bitmap does not scale well.
but drawing from bitmap to screen does...
I was thinking of drawing as much as I can directly to the screen
right now I draw at full scale from tiles to level_background and level_buffer
then only scale those when drawing to the screen.
so that would not affect the quality there, but maybe the rotation
also maybe the speed



enemies that still use trigger box, pod, vine
could I make them also optionally use trigger inputs
then they could move out of the way of bullets!

what would it take to extend lifts to use splines?

I would also like to make splines have more control points, maybe I'll have to make my own..


here is a huge one:
can level editor be brought under the program state umbrella?
I sort of duplicate level editor modes with program states



I want to see if I can make the player motion more smooth..
especially when riding lifts
but also when the background is scrolling

the player and the rocket might benefit from drawing directly on the screen instead of the screen buffer
it worked for bottom messages, the scaling looks ways better..

I would be nice be be able to do tc and netem things from within my program..
but I would need to figure out how to do that as non-root

If I did I could even do cool things like run training sessions with different network settings...



make a way to force x axis to show either frames or sec..
make a way to measure on graph
like CTRL SHIFT DRAG will display info about box size

make log in settings better:
- make a way to load most recent ping graph with one click
log like cpu, but with a multicolored bar...move, draw, other, all added up
...more



Things to add to settings:

optional resolution in window title
- I can already show it with debug overlay

optional text in bottom frame

main menu level editor shortcut key

level editor ov lock key

options to do the send stuff to clients? including which clients to send to, and text entry to add new ones????
then maybe I could retrieve log from client after netgame???...whoa...that's just crazy

what are the next things I can profile?
how long does it take client to decompress, run a dif, rewind?
how long does a bomb explosion take?
low long does it take to switch blocks?
how long does it take to draw all the blocks?
how long does it take to draw all messages?


what about the other timing thing I was going to do?
start of frame, and where everything else happened....not sure how useful that will be....

I wanted to experiment with differnt s1 and s2 values, but I wanted to be able to actually measure some effect it has.
that was the big push behind the program state thing, then the graph thing, then the settings menu because I want to be able
to measure stuff...



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I would like to make a mode where the server can run without a local player
I would like to be able to start it from the command line via ssh and control it like that too..
This would kind of suggest that I be able to pause the server...

Fundamentally this will require deep changes.
Right now the sync loop is dependant on the frame_num incrementing, like when the game is running.

This is not a deal breaker, the game loop can still run, just the local server player will not be participating..
There would be no menu stuff possible on the server though. I would need a different way to control it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
when client starts,
don't show anything about level until initial state is received and client player's view is at the start
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

add 8 char name
it will be saved in config file
it will be the name used for player[0]
where ever I print Player:x, i will now print 'name'





--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
as a pre cursor to layered recording
make a demo player on steroids
slider for speed
slider for location
pause, play.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Layered multiplayer recording
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How can I do a layered multiplayer recording, where a new player can record while paying back all the old ones?

single player local mode only

play and record mode..

for example:

play file:....
at a specific time start record one player...


I would need a new type of game...

like rungame_record


how does active local player work in rungame mode...


I might need a second game_move_array for this

while recording, copy from original and add from new playing...


how much space is used already by gma?

a drop in the bucket compared to everything else:
16M out of 1300M

so, make a second array

gma2


in rungame all active players have control method 1

make a new control method...like 6 for record rungame


Control panel

file loaded:
timeline with all 8 possible players and a line shown where there is data for each player
current position in savegame

able to seek to any pos
play and pause

set position and record for one player


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
to something more graceful if the next level is not found..
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

option 1: search for next level
option 2: if load fails go back to current level

whatever you do, do not just fail and leave a failed level loaded with menu...
I have changed it to print error to console and merr message on failure
------------------------------------------------------------------


------------------------------------------------------------------
8 character name for player...
------------------------------------------------------------------
I use 8 char for 'player x' already so the text should fit



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
display window hystersis adjust
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the display window hystersis window thing shoould slowly drift in the direction the player is looking, so they can see further thay way..this is genius and should have been done a long time ago

it works but still needs some bugs worked out

take the players motion into account
if jumping then scroll to see more up
if falling then scroll to see more down

if riding rocket then do the same....

can I just use pxinc and pyinc??
what I am doing is moving the camera...

in hyst gradual:
if you are running in one direction, you will be pushed up against the hyst for that direction
I want it be be ahead of you so you can see where you are going
same with jumping and falling and rockets
some way of using players speed....

---------------------------------


-------------------------------------------------
in log file viewer, make a second array with only the lines that we are showing
this will make the scrolling up and down make much more sense
can do page up and page down intelligently
moving up and down by one line (or 10 or 100) will actually do what we expect
-------------------------------------------------



code stat to do optional alphabetical sort also optional skip header files


make level editor save the window position
make a way to click and drag to move le window
make a button to have le window show current item in center


add a bunch of settings for bottom message:
how many lines: 8 (max 20)
float io = 1.0; // initial opacity
float fo = 0.1; // final opacity
float ivs = 0.5; // initial v size
float fvs = 0.1; // final v size
float ihs = 0.5; // initial h size
float fhs = 0.1; // final h size

which game events cause messages

player tile, text or both
enemy  tile, text or both
item   tile, text or both

how close the player has to be to reduce messages





















-------------------------------------------------
Make an 'about' just like 'help'
-------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Make it so that a client does not have to have the level a server is serving.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am so close anyway.
All that needs to be done is also sync the lift steps...
and the pmgstext

Then every part of the necessary game state is sent.

This way a server can edit a level and clients can play it without needing a copy....

Variables used to save levels in pml format

level_header:    80
l           : 40000
item        : 32000
Efi         :  6400
Ei          : 12800
lifts       :  5280
lift_steps  : 38400
pmsgtext    :250000
------------:------
total       :384960

Variables used for netgame state exchange

players  :  1664
Ei       : 12800
Efi      :  6400
item     : 32000
itemf    : 32000
lifts    :  5280
l        : 40000
---------:------
total    :106144


this will add
lift_steps  : 38400
wait...I also need pmsgtext, and that is not trivial
maybe during join I can compress and send these static things once...
maybe I could send the level file, it is already compressed...

the biggest levels are only 8K
I can already send the state broken up into packets, why not the level??




-------------------------------------------------
Implement a system of data about levels played and results
-------------------------------------------------
keep a text file when ever a level is completed (or abandonded)

abandoned? whenever going to menu and resume allowed?
this part is not essential, only wanted to see how many times started and not finished

level_num
date and time stamp (completed or started)
time to complete
number of players
shots fired
enemies killed
purple coins
enemies left alive at the end
number of deaths

one line per level started?
when complete edit the line

what is the end result?

list of levels with number of times started, completed, abandoned
max time, min time, avg time, total time
enemies left max, min avg
purple coins, max, min avg



-------------------------------------------------
make end pieces for chains and maybe vines and ladders and ropes
-------------------------------------------------
What if I gave my levels names?
That way if they are re-arranged it wont matter
-------------------------------------------------
What if I had an overlay screen for levels
This all sounds very complex...
-------------------------------------------------


------------------------------------------------------
------------------------ Level ideas -----------------
------------------------------------------------------

make a level with block 0 and 1 that look the same but set block manip to change block 1...

make a level that requires traveling on a lift while jumping on and off of switches

level where you have to throw mines at the other player..

How about a level where you have to clone switches??

how about a level where you need to send rocket up through a minefield
or arrow field that player would die in....

level with 100 random flapper...vertical jumping section in middle...332

how about a level where you have a cannon following you through a constricting one way
maze, probably up past semi solid and then kill it with a bomb

make a level that relies on being able to carry a door through a door

------------------------------------------------------
------------------------ ememy ideas -----------------
------------------------------------------------------

how about an enemy that jumps over the player and fires down when directly over
invincible to sideways player shots

What if I made a cloner that could detect when what it created was destroyed and make a new ones?

what if I made on option for cloner to destroy all that it had created when trigger to create more...
that could be useful for timed things and other stuff

what if when a player is in a cloner src that fires, a free man is created?


------------------------------------------------------
------------------------ item ideas ------------------
------------------------------------------------------

make a green ball that you need to carry to its corresponding base to emit a trigger event


make the type of key you need to take to a matching lock
when you touch the lock it will show the blocks that get removed

something you jump on just like a switch
only emits toggle on and toggle off depending on shape...

something you shoot and it emits a trigger
make an obvious item that reacts when getting shot... toggle on and off..


matching set of items that need to be brought together
you can carry these around just like items...

what if you could carry around normal triggers and the field would follow?


trigger field that has a count of enemies or items or players

how about making health bonus only take the amount of health needed to get to 100
if any is left, just subtract and don't erase the item

what if you had to press FIRE to grab a rocket, but then after that you did not need to hold FIRE?
you could dismount with JUMP? ... that sounds cool

does remote trigger have a delay before the explosion?
I want it immediate to help the player time exploding moving things

make a field that manipulates the players controls, like gravity, etc...

The level editor has four major modes:

1 - Main editor
- most common way to draw blocks and add objects from selection window
- also can set draw item with mouse b2 and put draw item with mouse b1
- the only mode that has the pop-up menu

2 - Zoom Full Screen
- mostly used for manipulating rectagular selections of the level
- clear, copy, paste, move, save and load selection to disk...
- block fill, block frame, block floodfill

3 - Object Viewer
- used for manipulating properties of indiviudual objects, (items, enemies, lifts)
- can move and edit object properties with buttons and sliders
- can move and edit object properties with map

4 - Group Edit
- used for maninulating groups of objects (items and enemies)
- can set or randomize locations, variables, etc


All modes have a scalable level in the background.
It can be adjusted just like when the game is running
- scale can be adjusted with F5/F6
- fullscreen can be toggled with F12
- CTRL SHIFT F12 cycles the ortho double

end of level stats:

number of:

enemies left
enemies killed
shots fired

per player:
enemies killed
shots fired
damage taken
health picked up


make more items that help the puzzle aspect.
like??

a key and lock type thing where you need to bring the key to the lock

companion cubes you can carry around
to jump off or weigh down switches

blocks that take more that one hit to clear

helpless victims that you need to rescue by bringing them to a safe spot

enemy that freezes when you look at it

make more shapes for player, I don't like static shape when jumping or falling

better profiling to find bottleneck

add a more things to customize:
like:

hystersis window
screen messages
bottom messages

make the main game loop called from the event loop
instead of calling the event loop from game loop
see if this improves performance

fix hysteresis window move when zooming

make other kind of mines, like spikes, lava, flames...etc

make player wall collisions pixel perfect like when on ladder???
make single block navigation like ladder move...
this will make jumping up into single block opening very hard...
this sound like a major re-write..
