------------------------ To Do --------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------


I want to have a permanently saved log graph like the temporary one on remote

once per frame, a single log message that has all the stuff needed to make graph
actually it will need to have one for each client as well...

then I will need a method to get server logs off the server so I can view them

remove all passwords from the sources...
or better yet change all your passwords to something new....


where am I going to put all my videos where I show off cool stuff?

ideas for those videos:
logging
netgame stress test
netgame max cor
profiling
logo

level editor

historic:
original sprite and palette editor from 1997
original enemy group edit
split screen multiplayer
what the game looked like in different versions



write the multiplayer history




--------------------


improve server remote control

- changing more settings remotely
what exactly do you want to do?

these are all the things I can think of:
logging options
autosave game and log options


sections:

controls
segregate netgame debug controls

collapsible panels

like for graphs

how about if client is the first to join headless server
then server should change to match that client, like color, shots, level...












the server breaking up a payload into chunks and sending is done in 3 separate places:
stdf
snfo
sfil

is there any way to make that common?

I think they all have slightly different headers??

      mPacketBuffer.PacketName(data, pos, "stdf");
      mPacketBuffer.PacketPutInt4(data, pos, src);
      mPacketBuffer.PacketPutInt4(data, pos, dst);
      mPacketBuffer.PacketPutByte(data, pos, packet_num);
      mPacketBuffer.PacketPutByte(data, pos, num_packets);
      mPacketBuffer.PacketPutByte(data, pos, mPlayer.syn[0].server_lev_seq_num);
      mPacketBuffer.PacketPutInt4(data, pos, start_byte);
      mPacketBuffer.PacketPutInt4(data, pos, packet_data_size);


      mPacketBuffer.PacketName(data, pos, "snfo");
      mPacketBuffer.PacketPutInt4(data, pos, mLoop.frame_num);
      mPacketBuffer.PacketPutByte(data, pos, packet_num);
      mPacketBuffer.PacketPutByte(data, pos, num_packets);
      mPacketBuffer.PacketPutInt4(data, pos, start_byte);
      mPacketBuffer.PacketPutInt4(data, pos, packet_data_size);


      mPacketBuffer.PacketName(data, pos, "sfil");
      mPacketBuffer.PacketPutInt4(data, pos, files_to_send[i].id);
      mPacketBuffer.PacketPutByte(data, pos, packet_num);
      mPacketBuffer.PacketPutByte(data, pos, num_packets);
      mPacketBuffer.PacketPutInt4(data, pos, start_byte);
      mPacketBuffer.PacketPutInt4(data, pos, packet_data_size);
      mPacketBuffer.PacketPutInt4(data, pos, fsize); // uncompressed file size

stdf 23  memcpy(client_state_buffer + sb, mPacketBuffer.rx_buf[i].data+23, sz);
sfil 22  memcpy(client_sfil_buffer + sb, mPacketBuffer.rx_buf[i].data+22, sz);
snfo 18  memcpy(client_state_buffer + sb, mPacketBuffer.rx_buf[i].data+18, sz);


what do they all have in common?

      mPacketBuffer.PacketPutByte(data, pos, packet_num);
      mPacketBuffer.PacketPutByte(data, pos, num_packets);
      mPacketBuffer.PacketPutInt4(data, pos, start_byte);
      mPacketBuffer.PacketPutInt4(data, pos, packet_data_size);

what if I started by aligning those 4 things to the start?

also they all have something they use as a primary key to mark that they all belong to a set...
stdf uses dst    client_state_buffer_pieces[seq] = dst;
snfo uses frame  client_state_buffer_pieces[seq] = fn;
sfil uses id     client_sfil_buffer_pieces[seq] = id;

even if I don't do anything more I want to do that:


new:
   mPacketBuffer.PacketName(data, pos, "stdf");
   mPacketBuffer.PacketPutByte(data, pos, packet_num);
   mPacketBuffer.PacketPutByte(data, pos, num_packets);
   mPacketBuffer.PacketPutInt4(data, pos, start_byte);
   mPacketBuffer.PacketPutInt4(data, pos, packet_data_size);
   mPacketBuffer.PacketPutInt4(data, pos, dst);
   mPacketBuffer.PacketPutInt4(data, pos, src);
   mPacketBuffer.PacketPutByte(data, pos, mPlayer.syn[0].server_lev_seq_num);

   mPacketBuffer.PacketName(data, pos, "snfo");
   mPacketBuffer.PacketPutByte(data, pos, packet_num);
   mPacketBuffer.PacketPutByte(data, pos, num_packets);
   mPacketBuffer.PacketPutInt4(data, pos, start_byte);
   mPacketBuffer.PacketPutInt4(data, pos, packet_data_size);
   mPacketBuffer.PacketPutInt4(data, pos, mLoop.frame_num);

   mPacketBuffer.PacketName(data, pos, "sfil");
   mPacketBuffer.PacketPutByte(data, pos, packet_num);
   mPacketBuffer.PacketPutByte(data, pos, num_packets);
   mPacketBuffer.PacketPutInt4(data, pos, start_byte);
   mPacketBuffer.PacketPutInt4(data, pos, packet_data_size);
   mPacketBuffer.PacketPutInt4(data, pos, files_to_send[i].id);
   mPacketBuffer.PacketPutInt4(data, pos, fsize); // uncompressed file size

can I make netem stuff work with a script on server??

https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000016906

this is what I want:

I want to be able to run tc netem

but I need to be root...


should I just abandon old syle cpu graph??
it is nice that it does not reset when screen changes
commented out for now...
could I measure the time it takes to draw it?, like eco_draw?


Where can I do one place to store version?

so it will show in the compiled program
and also be used for lin and win build scripts

right now I change it in three places...code (pm.h), win and lin make_release..


make the cannon facing direction optional

make the shortcut keys in the menu optional
also shortcut key in vls

make functionality to save level if if beats the best time with purple coins
that means I will need to track that also...

make it so that demo current level on overworld does something besides open file select
maybe that is not so bad...

make much simpler history page for help screens

add to history

also fix history on index.html page

maybe have a nice short history and then an in depth one


remove log file viewer and graphs from help screens?? why?

somehow describe snap...

hiders

npc



redoing docs one page at a time, since globals and fixed are removed


level array goes into a lot of the drawing sequence, that I don't think it should
should put that in its own file

there is some major rewriting needed for events and inputs

it is because of rewind
how am I going to fix it?
set a global flag when rewinding....
don't send game events when flag set...
done...

-- Random thoughts and ideas --
-------------------------------


BUGS HERE IS THE MOST META BUG OF ALL!!!

I want this game to show off my awesome skills.
So everything that is not perfect will reflect badly on me.
This is why it is so hard to finish, it will never be perfect...

add al_set_clipboard_text for info things


I have a thought about program state and how I save in in an array that slides down so I can see previous states...
What if the proper code structure for that was a stack?
push on a new state and to go back pop it off?


look at making screen double do values other than integers like 1.5

make "Rollin" play over final cutscene
time:93s

how long for all children to get in rocket?
30s
how long for rocket to fly


should I redo my commandline stuff to have an arbitrary number of options in any order
spec out exactly what you want.
each chuck should contain no whitespace, use that as a delimiter

-e
-e:<int>

-p
-p:<int>

-s
-sh

-c
-c<host>


Make some examples of vinepods to show off in levels
vinepod triggering another vinepod in a chain
vinepod triggering a group of vinepods in a star
vinepod getting out of the way of a shot aimed at it

vinepod flower on good and evil?
also on incinerator??

I could also do an eco draw for vinepods....

when a level is completed and sets a new time record < par and all purple coins collected
auto save that level in a special folder

here are the rules:
- level completed
- all coins
- time less than max so far

this makes me think I might need 2 speed records
one for all coins and one for not..
maybe I could just not count a speed record if all coins are not collected
too much work, just leave it...



what about messages and in level stats only show on local screen?
unless they are the show always type...
level_stats is a message also...
there is no mechanism in message to determine which player to show it for..
it would take a lot to add functionality to display different for each player
skip this




can I add level name to the filename
How would that look?

level002.pml

level002_Switch_Nest.pml


I am thinking of having some more buttons on the top of the edit menu

be able to toggle scroll at screen edge on/off
lock screen pos
scroll level by click and drag
zoom level with mouse wheel


working on making the ft_sel look better
all the info I need is in the ft_
the secondaries already have the right offset but the drawing routine can only get it from the real item data structs
I hate re invent or duplicate the drawing routines, can I just extend the exiting ones to pass explicit secondary, like I pass explicit x and y for cutom drawing?


why did I remove skip frame draw?
because 99% of the time, the thing was taking too much time was draw frame itself
netgame expects that the move frames happen exactly when they are supposed to
if I draw then I will screw up the timimg of netgame
I tried a staggered draw but the flashing was too much...
what I did not try was:
frame 1 get new background and draw


wait a tick here!
I have discovered that drawing from bitmap to bitmap does not scale well.
but drawing from bitmap to screen does...
I was thinking of drawing as much as I can directly to the screen
right now I draw at full scale from tiles to level_background and level_buffer
then only scale those when drawing to the screen.
so that would not affect the quality there, but maybe the rotation
also maybe the speed



enemies that still use trigger box, pod, vine
could I make them also optionally use trigger inputs
then they could move out of the way of bullets!

what would it take to extend lifts to use splines?

I would also like to make splines have more control points, maybe I'll have to make my own..

here is a huge one:
can level editor be brought under the program state umbrella?
I sort of duplicate level editor modes with program states

I want to see if I can make the player motion more smooth..
especially when riding lifts
but also when the background is scrolling

the player and the rocket might benefit from drawing directly on the screen instead of the screen buffer
it worked for bottom messages, the scaling looks ways better..

I would be nice be be able to do tc and netem things from within my program..
but I would need to figure out how to do that as non-root

If I did I could even do cool things like run training sessions with different network settings...

make a way to force x axis to show either frames or sec..
make a way to measure on graph
like CTRL SHIFT DRAG will display info about box size

make log in settings better:
- make a way to load most recent ping graph with one click
log like cpu, but with a multicolored bar...move, draw, other, all added up
...more

Things to add to settings:

optional resolution in window title
- I can already show it with debug overlay


optional text in bottom frame

main menu level editor shortcut key

level editor ov lock key

options to do the send stuff to clients? including which clients to send to, and text entry to add new ones????
then maybe I could retrieve log from client after netgame???...whoa...that's just crazy

what are the next things I can profile?
how long does it take client to decompress, run a dif, rewind?
how long does a bomb explosion take?
low long does it take to switch blocks?
how long does it take to draw all the blocks?
how long does it take to draw all messages?

what about the other timing thing I was going to do?
start of frame, and where everything else happened....not sure how useful that will be....





--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I would like to make a mode where the server can run without a local player
I would like to be able to start it from the command line via ssh and control it like that too..
This would kind of suggest that I be able to pause the server...

Fundamentally this will require deep changes.
Right now the sync loop is dependant on the frame_num incrementing, like when the game is running.

This is not a deal breaker, the game loop can still run, just the local server player will not be participating..
There would be no menu stuff possible on the server though. I would need a different way to control it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
when client starts,
don't show anything about level until initial state is received and client player's view is at the start
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

add 8 char name
it will be saved in config file
it will be the name used for player[0]
where ever I print Player:x, i will now print 'name'





--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
as a pre cursor to layered recording
make a demo player on steroids
slider for speed
slider for location
pause, play.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Layered multiplayer recording
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How can I do a layered multiplayer recording, where a new player can record while paying back all the old ones?

single player local mode only

play and record mode..

for example:

play file:....
at a specific time start record one player...


I would need a new type of game...

like rungame_record


how does active local player work in rungame mode...


I might need a second game_move_array for this

while recording, copy from original and add from new playing...


how much space is used already by gma?

a drop in the bucket compared to everything else:
16M out of 1300M

so, make a second array

gma2


in rungame all active players have control method 1

make a new control method...like 6 for record rungame


Control panel

file loaded:
timeline with all 8 possible players and a line shown where there is data for each player
current position in savegame

able to seek to any pos
play and pause

set position and record for one player


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
to something more graceful if the next level is not found..
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

option 1: search for next level
option 2: if load fails go back to current level

whatever you do, do not just fail and leave a failed level loaded with menu...
I have changed it to print error to console and merr message on failure
------------------------------------------------------------------


------------------------------------------------------------------
8 character name for player...
------------------------------------------------------------------
I use 8 char for 'player x' already so the text should fit



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
display window hystersis adjust
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the display window hystersis window thing shoould slowly drift in the direction the player is looking, so they can see further thay way..this is genius and should have been done a long time ago

it works but still needs some bugs worked out

take the players motion into account
if jumping then scroll to see more up
if falling then scroll to see more down

if riding rocket then do the same....

can I just use pxinc and pyinc??
what I am doing is moving the camera...

in hyst gradual:
if you are running in one direction, you will be pushed up against the hyst for that direction
I want it be be ahead of you so you can see where you are going
same with jumping and falling and rockets
some way of using players speed....

---------------------------------


-------------------------------------------------
in log file viewer, make a second array with only the lines that we are showing
this will make the scrolling up and down make much more sense
can do page up and page down intelligently
moving up and down by one line (or 10 or 100) will actually do what we expect
-------------------------------------------------

code stat to do optional alphabetical sort also optional skip header files


make level editor save the window position
make a way to click and drag to move le window
make a button to have le window show current item in center


I have been thinking about a major re-ordering of levels...
I have so many mediocre ones mixed in with the great ones...
I just want to re-arrange and put some more of them in the extra categories....


right now I have:
8 training levels
40 main game
1 final rocket level
12 extra
14 demo
2 multiplayer bomb toss


what if I was to remove 8 from regular and add them to extra

which 8



-------------------------------------------------
Make an 'about' just like 'help'
-------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Make it so that a client does not have to have the level a server is serving.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am so close anyway.
All that needs to be done is also sync the lift steps...
and the pmgstext

Then every part of the necessary game state is sent.

This way a server can edit a level and clients can play it without needing a copy....

Variables used to save levels in pml format

level_header:    80
l           : 40000
item        : 32000
Efi         :  6400
Ei          : 12800
lifts       :  5280
lift_steps  : 38400
pmsgtext    :250000
------------:------
total       :384960

Variables used for netgame state exchange

players  :  1664
Ei       : 12800
Efi      :  6400
item     : 32000
itemf    : 32000
lifts    :  5280
l        : 40000
---------:------
total    :106144


this will add
lift_steps  : 38400
wait...I also need pmsgtext, and that is not trivial
maybe during join I can compress and send these static things once...
maybe I could send the level file, it is already compressed...

the biggest levels are only 8K
I can already send the state broken up into packets, why not the level??



-------------------------------------------------
Implement a system of data about levels played and results
-------------------------------------------------
keep a text file when ever a level is completed (or abandonded)

abandoned? whenever going to menu and resume allowed?
this part is not essential, only wanted to see how many times started and not finished

level_num
date and time stamp (completed or started)
time to complete
number of players
shots fired
enemies killed
purple coins
enemies left alive at the end
number of deaths

one line per level started?
when complete edit the line

what is the end result?

list of levels with number of times started, completed, abandoned
max time, min time, avg time, total time
enemies left max, min avg
purple coins, max, min avg



-------------------------------------------------
make end pieces for chains and maybe vines and ladders and ropes
-------------------------------------------------
What if I gave my levels names?
That way if they are re-arranged it wont matter
-------------------------------------------------
What if I had an overlay screen for levels
This all sounds very complex...
-------------------------------------------------


------------------------------------------------------
------------------------ Level ideas -----------------
------------------------------------------------------

make a level with block 0 and 1 that look the same but set block manip to change block 1...

make a level that requires traveling on a lift while jumping on and off of switches

level where you have to throw mines at the other player..

How about a level where you have to clone switches??

how about a level where you need to send rocket up through a minefield
or arrow field that player would die in....

level with 100 random flapper...vertical jumping section in middle...332

how about a level where you have a cannon following you through a constricting one way
maze, probably up past semi solid and then kill it with a bomb

make a level that relies on being able to carry a door through a door

------------------------------------------------------
------------------------ ememy ideas -----------------
------------------------------------------------------

how about an enemy that jumps over the player and fires down when directly over
invincible to sideways player shots

What if I made a cloner that could detect when what it created was destroyed and make a new ones?

what if I made on option for cloner to destroy all that it had created when trigger to create more...
that could be useful for timed things and other stuff

what if when a player is in a cloner src that fires, a free man is created?


------------------------------------------------------
------------------------ item ideas ------------------
------------------------------------------------------

make a green ball that you need to carry to its corresponding base to emit a trigger event


make the type of key you need to take to a matching lock
when you touch the lock it will show the blocks that get removed

something you jump on just like a switch
only emits toggle on and toggle off depending on shape...

something you shoot and it emits a trigger
make an obvious item that reacts when getting shot... toggle on and off..


matching set of items that need to be brought together
you can carry these around just like items...

what if you could carry around normal triggers and the field would follow?


trigger field that has a count of enemies or items or players

how about making health bonus only take the amount of health needed to get to 100
if any is left, just subtract and don't erase the item

what if you had to press FIRE to grab a rocket, but then after that you did not need to hold FIRE?
you could dismount with JUMP? ... that sounds cool

does remote trigger have a delay before the explosion?
I want it immediate to help the player time exploding moving things

make a field that manipulates the players controls, like gravity, etc...

The level editor has four major modes:

1 - Main editor
- most common way to draw blocks and add objects from selection window
- also can set draw item with mouse b2 and put draw item with mouse b1
- the only mode that has the pop-up menu

2 - Zoom Full Screen
- mostly used for manipulating rectagular selections of the level
- clear, copy, paste, move, save and load selection to disk...
- block fill, block frame, block floodfill

3 - Object Viewer
- used for manipulating properties of indiviudual objects, (items, enemies, lifts)
- can move and edit object properties with buttons and sliders
- can move and edit object properties with map

4 - Group Edit
- used for maninulating groups of objects (items and enemies)
- can set or randomize locations, variables, etc


All modes have a scalable level in the background.
It can be adjusted just like when the game is running
- scale can be adjusted with F5/F6
- fullscreen can be toggled with F12
- CTRL SHIFT F12 cycles the ortho double

end of level stats:

number of:

enemies left
enemies killed
shots fired

per player:
enemies killed
shots fired
damage taken
health picked up


make more items that help the puzzle aspect.
like??

a key and lock type thing where you need to bring the key to the lock

companion cubes you can carry around
to jump off or weigh down switches

blocks that take more that one hit to clear

helpless victims that you need to rescue by bringing them to a safe spot

enemy that freezes when you look at it

make more shapes for player, I don't like static shape when jumping or falling

better profiling to find bottleneck

add a more things to customize:
like:

hystersis window
screen messages
bottom messages

make the main game loop called from the event loop
instead of calling the event loop from game loop
see if this improves performance

fix hysteresis window move when zooming

make other kind of mines, like spikes, lava, flames...etc

make player wall collisions pixel perfect like when on ladder???
make single block navigation like ladder move...
this will make jumping up into single block opening very hard...
this sound like a major re-write..
