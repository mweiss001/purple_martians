This is me trying to document the new method.

New as in 2023


The client sync now uses a much faster method.
It's target is to stay ahead of the server.
This means when the client gets difs, it may need to rewind to apply them.

Why was this neccesary?
I think it has to do with the server getting late cdats from clients.
And the only way to fix that was to let the client stay ahead of the server.

I wanted the client to be ahead of the server (why?) but when it did the client complained about late difs
I fixed that by allowing the client to rewind...








The server keeps a copy of the last state it used to send difs to clients.

Very high level approach:

When sending a new state, the server:
- loads the last saved state
- plays forward and applies late client inputs
- saves a new state and sends that to clients


More detail:

There are 2 timing windows: s1 and s2

They are measured in frames and control the amount of rewind and replay around the state.

int s1 = players1[0].s1;
int s2 = players1[0].s2;
int s3 = s1+s2;

// is it time to make a new dif and send to clients?
if (frame_num == srv_stdf_state_frame_num[1] + s3)
{


s1 is the frequency that states are made and difs are sent

why do I need s2?
what is its purpose??

If i did not have s2, the server would send difs and they would arrive too late for client???


can I draw some diagrams?
