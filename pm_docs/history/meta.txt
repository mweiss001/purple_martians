I am having a hard time working on these history documents...

I have so many different versions, and when I edit one, the changes do not apply to the others...

I have tried many times and got lost....


What if I tried to make smaller documents?

Like I have one just covers purple martians through its develeopment...

Those files I should prefix with MASTER and only change them...


MASTER_Brief History
Deals with Purple Martians only.
Years, versions, software, features




I found some more info!
An old paper notebook with some dates..
