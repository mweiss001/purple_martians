The executable is named 'pm'

From a console in the game directory, type './pm'

Requires liballegro_monolith.so.5.2 

Some distro's are missing: libOpenGL.so.0

Requires libdumb.so.1 for the soundtrack


All are included in /linux_libs/

If the libraries are not found automatically...

Option 1:
Use the script 'pml' to run the game:
The contents of pml are: 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./linux_libs ./pm "$@"'

Option 2:
Copy the contents of ./linux_libs to /usr/lib by running the script 'lin_install_libs' like this:
sudo ./lin_install_libs
Then you can run './pm' without needing the script
