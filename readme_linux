The executable is called 'pm'

It requires liballegro_monolith.so.5.2
Some distro's are also missing: libOpenGL.so.0
They are both included in /linux_libs/

If the libraries are not found automatically...

Option 1:
Use the script 'pml' to run the game:
The contents of pml are:  "LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./linux_libs ./pm"

Option 2:
Copy the contents of /linux_libs to /usr/lib by running the script 'lin_install_libs' like this:
sudo ./lin_install_libs
Then you can run 'pm' without needing the script
