The executable is called 'pm'

It requires liballegro_monolith.so.5.2
It is included in /linux_libs/

It should be found automatically because -rpath is set in the binary executable pm

If for some reason it cannot be found....

Option 1:
Use the script 'pml' to run the game:
The contents of pml are:  "LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./linux_libs ./pm"

Option 2:
Copy the contents of /linux_libs to /usr/lib
Then you can run 'pm' without needing the script
